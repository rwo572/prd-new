Since the PRD is empty or you're starting fresh, first identify the product stage:

## What stage is your product at?

**Choose one:**

üöÄ **0‚Üí1 (Discovery & Validation)** 
Creating something completely new. You need to validate product-market fit through rapid experimentation.
- No existing users or product
- Exploring problem space
- Building MVP

üìà **1‚Üín (Scaling & Growth)**
You have initial traction and want to scale. Focus on expanding proven value to more users/segments.
- 100-1000 existing users
- Product-market fit validated
- Ready to grow

‚ö° **n‚Üíx (Optimization & Differentiation)**
Mature product seeking optimization. Focus on market leadership and advanced features.
- 10,000+ users
- Established market position
- Optimizing for scale

Please tell me which stage best describes your product, and I'll guide you through the appropriate PRD creation process with targeted questions.`

For a 0‚Üí1 product, ask these key questions:

1. **Core Problem**: What specific problem are you solving that hasn't been solved before? What evidence do you have that this problem exists?

2. **Beachhead Customer**: Who is your initial target user segment? Be specific - "busy professionals" is too broad. Think "product managers at B2B SaaS startups with 50-200 employees."

3. **Riskiest Assumption**: What's the biggest assumption that, if wrong, would invalidate your entire approach? How will you test it quickly?

4. **AI Capability**: What type of AI capability is core to your solution?
   - Generation (creating content/code/designs)
   - Classification (categorizing/routing/filtering)
   - Recommendation (suggesting next actions)
   - Analysis (extracting insights/patterns)

5. **Success Criteria**: How will you know you've achieved initial product-market fit? (e.g., 10+ users complete core workflow, 40% would be "very disappointed" without it)

After getting answers, I'll generate a comprehensive 0‚Üí1 PRD using our AI PRD template that includes:
- Executive Summary with vision and 4-week MVP timeline
- Problem Definition with evidence and assumptions
- Solution Design with MVP scope
- Behavioral Contract for AI
- Validation Strategy with experiments
- Kill Criteria (what would make you stop)
- Resource Requirements (~$1,000 budget)
- Immediate next actions

Please answer these questions, and I'll create your PRD.

1. **Current State**: What's working well with your existing product? What are your key metrics (users, retention, NPS)? What feedback patterns have emerged?

2. **Growth Lever**: What's your primary growth constraint right now?
   - Awareness (people don't know you exist)
   - Activation (users try but don't succeed)
   - Retention (users leave after initial use)
   - Expansion (users want more capabilities)

3. **Segment Expansion**: Which adjacent user segment represents your best growth opportunity? How similar are their needs to your current users?

4. **AI Enhancement**: How can AI capabilities amplify your proven value?
   - Personalization (adapting to user preferences)
   - Automation (removing manual steps)
   - Intelligence (smarter recommendations)
   - Scale (handling more complexity)

5. **Risk Management**: What could break as you scale 10x? What guardrails need to be in place?

After getting answers, I'll generate a comprehensive 1‚Üín PRD using our AI PRD template that includes:
- Executive Summary with 10x growth vision
- Market Analysis with TAM/SAM/SOM
- User Segmentation & Personas
- Feature Roadmap (Now/Next/Later)
- AI Enhancement Strategy
- Growth Metrics & Targets
- Technical Architecture for Scale
- Go-to-Market Strategy
- Risk Mitigation Plan

2. **Platform Vision**: How can you evolve from a product to a platform?
   - Ecosystem (third-party integrations)
   - Marketplace (user-generated value)
   - API/SDK (developer platform)
   - Multi-product suite

3. **Enterprise Readiness**: What enterprise features are blocking large deals?
   - Security & Compliance (SOC2, GDPR, SSO)
   - Administration (role-based access, audit logs)
   - Customization (white-label, workflows)
   - Support (SLAs, dedicated success)

4. **AI Moat**: What AI capabilities would be defensible and hard to replicate?
   - Proprietary data advantage
   - Custom model training
   - Domain-specific intelligence
   - Network effects from AI

5. **Strategic Bets**: What bold moves could create step-function growth? What would you build if you had unlimited resources?

Your task is to analyze the content and provide TWO distinct responses:

You MUST provide your response in exactly this format with the separator:

[IMPROVEMENTS]
## Key Improvements Needed

Provide 3-5 specific improvements in a conversational, easy-to-read format:
‚Ä¢ Issue: Clear explanation of what needs improvement
‚Ä¢ Why: Brief reason this matters
‚Ä¢ Fix: Specific recommendation

Use bullet points and clear formatting. Be conversational and direct.

[MARKDOWN_CHANGES]
## Suggested Markdown

Provide the EXACT markdown text that should replace or be inserted into the document.
This should be the actual content, properly formatted in markdown, ready to be inserted.
Keep it focused on the most important change.

IMPORTANT:
- The [IMPROVEMENTS] section should be styled text explaining the issues
- The [MARKDOWN_CHANGES] section should be the actual markdown to insert
- Always include both sections separated by the markers shown above

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
- For task lists and checklists, use standard markdown format: "- [ ] Task description"
- NEVER add extra bullets before checkboxes
- FORBIDDEN FORMATS: "‚Ä¢ - [ ]", "* - [ ]", "‚Ä¢ ‚òê"
- CORRECT FORMAT: "- [ ] Task description" with proper line breaks
- Example: "- [ ] Set up development environment" NOT "‚Ä¢ - [ ] Set up development environment"
- Use proper line breaks between tasks for readability
- For user stories, use numbered lists or bullets, NOT checkboxes
- Keep formatting clean and readable`
