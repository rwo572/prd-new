## 1. Executive Summary
**Vision**: Building a ${aiCapability ? `${aiCapability} AI` : 'solution'} that ${coreProblem || 'solves an unmet need'} for ${targetUser || 'early adopters'}.

**Opportunity**: Validate product-market fit through rapid experimentation with minimal investment.

**Success Criteria**: 
- 10+ users complete core workflow
- 40% report they'd be "very disappointed" without it
- 3+ users willing to pre-order/pay

## 2. Problem Definition

### Core Problem
${coreProblem || '**[To be validated]** Users struggle with manual processes that could be automated intelligently.'}

### Evidence & Impact
- **Quantitative**: [Gather data on time/cost impact]
- **Qualitative**: [User interview insights]
- **Market Signal**: Technology enablers newly available

### Riskiest Assumptions
1. **Problem exists**: Users experience sufficient pain
2. **Solution fit**: Our approach meaningfully addresses it
3. **Willingness to pay**: Value exceeds cost threshold

## 3. Solution Design

### Why AI?
- Human approaches are too slow/expensive
- Pattern recognition enables new capabilities
- Competitive advantage through automation

### MVP Scope (4 weeks)
| Phase | Focus | Success Metric |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Week 1-2 | Core POC | Technical feasibility proven |
| Week 3 | User testing | 5/10 complete workflow |
| Week 4 | Iteration | Incorporate feedback |

### Out of Scope (v1)
- Advanced features
- Multiple integrations
- Full automation
- Team features

## 4. Behavioral Contract${aiCapability ? `

### Core Personality
- **Tone**: Helpful, clear, humble about limitations
- **Expertise**: Acknowledges beta status
- **Boundaries**: Clear about what it can't do

### Behavioral Examples (MVP)
| Scenario | Good Response | Bad Response |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Ambiguous input | "Could you clarify X?" | Making assumptions |
| Edge case | "I'm not sure, let me escalate" | Incorrect guess |
| Success case | Clear, actionable output | Over-promising |` : ''}

## 5. Safety & Ethics

### MVP Safety Rules
- **Hard Boundaries**: No sensitive data processing

| 2 | Solution works | Prototype | 5/10 complete |
| 3 | Will pay | Pricing test | 3+ commit |

### Learning Goals
1. Problem-solution fit
2. Minimum feature set
3. Pricing sensitivity
4. Technical feasibility

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| No product-market fit | Medium | High | Fast pivots |
| Technical complexity | Low | Medium | Use proven APIs |
| User adoption | Medium | High | Direct outreach |

## 11. Resource Requirements

### Team
- 1 Engineer (full-time)
- 1 Designer (part-time)
- 10 Beta users

### Budget
- Infrastructure: $500
- APIs: $500
- Total: $1,000

## 12. Kill Criteria

**Stop if by Week 4**:
- <30% users see value
- Core assumption disproven
- Technical approach not viable
- No path to differentiation

## 13. Next Actions

1. **Today**: Interview 5 potential users
2. **Tomorrow**: Create clickable prototype
3. **Day 3**: Technical spike on core feature
4. **Week 1 End**: Go/No-Go checkpoint
