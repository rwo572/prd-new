# AI PRD (0 → 1: New AI Product)

## Intro
This AI PRD captures requirements for a brand-new AI-driven product. Focus is on feasibility, quick iterations, and data/model validation.

## Problem & User Need
- Who is the user?
- What’s broken in their workflow?
- Why AI is the right approach?

## Goals & Success Metrics
- Initial task success rate, latency
- Guardrail metrics (hallucination rate)

## Data & Models
- Data sources identified (proprietary, public)
- Bias or coverage concerns
- Model choice (off-the-shelf vs fine-tuned)

## Evaluation & Benchmarks
- Simple truth set or eval harness
- Plan for quick A/B testing

## System Design
- Prototype stack (API calls, lightweight orchestration)
- Architecture assumptions

## Risks
- Model feasibility, cost
- Adoption/UX risks
