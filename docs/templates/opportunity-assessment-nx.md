# Opportunity Assessment (n^x: Incremental Improvements)

## Intro
This document outlines incremental improvements to an established product. These are smaller refinements that improve usability, efficiency, or customer delight at scale.

## Customer Centricity
- What minor pain points are we solving?
- Do these map to larger trends?

## Scope & Impact Analysis
- Which improvements should be prioritized?
- Trade-offs (impact, feasibility, cost)?

## Competitive Considerations & Risks
- Launch story in market
- Does this maintain or enhance competitive edge?
- Where do we expect to be copied?
- Risks to existing experience?

## Operational Execution & Scalability
- How will these improvements be implemented?
- What rollout strategy will minimize friction?

## Success Metrics & Feedback Loops
- Metrics for incremental value (usage, NPS bumps)
- Feedback loops for iteration
- Non-negotiable metrics that must not degrade (latency, reliability)
