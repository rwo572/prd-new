# PRD: AI-Powered Diagram Generation for Product Requirements

## Executive Summary

### Overview
This PRD defines a system that automatically generates visual diagrams from written product requirements, enabling product teams to create comprehensive documentation without manual diagramming effort.

### Problem
Product managers spend significant time creating and maintaining diagrams that duplicate information already written in their specifications. These diagrams often become outdated as requirements evolve, leading to confusion and misalignment.

### Solution
An AI-powered assistant that reads PRD content and automatically generates relevant Mermaid diagrams, ensuring visual documentation stays synchronized with written specifications.

### Impact
- 80% reduction in documentation time
- 100% consistency between text and diagrams
- Improved stakeholder comprehension
- Faster requirement reviews

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**1. Duplicate Effort**
- PMs write detailed specifications in text
- Then manually create diagrams conveying the same information
- Updates require changing both text and diagrams

**2. Inconsistent Documentation**
- Diagrams drift from specifications over time
- Different team members interpret requirements differently
- Visual representations may contradict written specs

**3. Time Constraints**
- Diagram creation often skipped due to deadlines
- Quality suffers when rushed
- Many PRDs lack visual aids entirely

**4. Skill Barriers**
- Not all PMs are proficient with diagramming tools
- Technical diagrams require specialized knowledge
- Learning curve for each new tool

### User Research Insights

From interviews with 50+ product managers:
- 78% report spending 2+ hours per PRD on diagrams
- 65% say their diagrams are outdated within 2 weeks
- 89% would value automatic diagram generation
- 92% prefer text-based diagram formats for version control

## Target Users

### Primary: Product Managers
- **Need**: Quick visualization of requirements
- **Pain**: Time spent on manual diagramming
- **Gain**: More time for strategic thinking

### Secondary: Engineering Teams
- **Need**: Clear technical specifications
- **Pain**: Ambiguous or missing diagrams
- **Gain**: Better understanding of requirements

### Tertiary: Stakeholders
- **Need**: Easy-to-understand documentation

## User Stories

### Core Functionality

**As a Product Manager, I want to:**
1. Write requirements in natural language and see relevant diagrams generated automatically
2. Review and refine suggested diagrams before including them in my PRD
3. Regenerate diagrams when I update the text specifications
4. Choose which types of diagrams are most appropriate for my content

**As an Engineer, I want to:**
1. See visual representations of user flows and system interactions
2. Understand data relationships through automatically generated ER diagrams
3. View sequence diagrams for API interactions without asking for them

**As a Stakeholder, I want to:**
1. Quickly understand system design through visual documentation
2. See how different components interact
3. Track changes through visual diff comparisons

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Content Analysis
The system analyzes PRD text to identify:
- User workflows and processes
- System components and interactions  
- Data entities and relationships
- API sequences and integrations
- State transitions and conditions

### 2. Automatic Diagram Generation

**Supported Diagram Types:**
- **Flowcharts**: For user journeys and decision flows
- **Sequence Diagrams**: For API calls and system interactions
- **ER Diagrams**: For data models and relationships
- **State Diagrams**: For system states and transitions
- **Architecture Diagrams**: For system components
- **Gantt Charts**: For project timelines

### 3. Smart Placement
- Diagrams appear contextually near relevant text
- Automatic sectioning based on content type
- Inline previews with expand options

### 4. Interactive Refinement
- Accept/reject generated diagrams
- Edit diagram content directly
- Provide feedback to improve future generations
- Save custom templates

### 5. Version Control Integration
- Diagrams stored as text (Mermaid syntax)
- Full Git compatibility
- Track changes over time
- Comment on diagrams in PRs

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: User Flow Documentation
**Scenario**: PM writes about password reset process
**Input**: "Users can reset their password by clicking 'Forgot Password', entering their email, receiving a reset link, clicking it, and setting a new password."
**Output**: Flowchart showing the complete password reset journey with decision points

### Use Case 2: API Specification
**Scenario**: PM describes checkout process
**Input**: "The checkout process involves the frontend calling the checkout API with cart items. The API validates the cart, calculates pricing, processes payment through Stripe, and returns order confirmation."
**Output**: Sequence diagram showing all system interactions

### Use Case 3: Data Model Definition
**Scenario**: PM defines user and project relationships
**Input**: "Users have profiles with name and email. Each user can create multiple projects. Projects contain tasks that can be assigned to users."
**Output**: ER diagram with proper relationships and cardinality

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- 80% of new PRDs use auto-generated diagrams within 6 months
- 90% of PMs actively using the feature within 3 months
- 50% reduction in requests for diagram creation

### Quality Metrics
- 85% diagram acceptance rate (not edited/rejected)
- 95% syntactic correctness of generated diagrams
- 90% semantic accuracy based on user feedback

### Efficiency Metrics
- 80% reduction in time spent creating diagrams
- 90% reduction in diagram update time
- 70% faster PRD review cycles

### Business Impact
- 30% improvement in requirement clarity scores
- 25% reduction in clarification meetings
- 40% decrease in requirement misunderstandings

## MVP Scope

### In Scope
1. Flowchart generation from user stories
2. Sequence diagram generation from API descriptions
3. ER diagram generation from data requirements
4. Basic accept/reject/edit functionality
5. Integration with existing PRD workflow

### Out of Scope
1. Real-time collaborative editing
2. Custom diagram types
3. Import from other tools
4. Advanced styling options
5. Multi-language support

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. PM writes requirements in their PRD
2. System analyzes content and identifies diagram opportunities
3. Diagrams are generated and displayed inline
4. PM reviews and can accept, edit, or reject
5. Accepted diagrams become part of the PRD
6. Updates to text trigger diagram regeneration

### Design Principles
- **Non-intrusive**: Don't interrupt writing flow
- **Contextual**: Place diagrams near relevant content
- **Transparent**: Show confidence levels and reasoning
- **Flexible**: Easy to override or customize
- **Consistent**: Maintain visual style across diagrams

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within existing PRD infrastructure
- Diagrams must be version-control friendly
- Performance must not impact writing experience
- Must support offline viewing of generated diagrams

### Business Constraints
- No additional licensing costs for diagram tools
- Must integrate with current PM workflows
- Cannot require specialized training
- Must comply with data security policies

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Poor diagram quality | High | Medium | Human review and feedback loop |
| User adoption resistance | High | Low | Gradual rollout with training |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Asynchronous generation |
| Over-reliance on AI | Medium | Medium | Emphasize human oversight |

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation will:
1. Generate relevant diagrams for 80%+ of PRD sections
2. Reduce diagram creation time by 80%
3. Achieve 90% user satisfaction rating
4. Maintain 100% text-diagram consistency
5. Support all major diagram types PMs need

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- Multi-diagram coordination and linking
- Import existing diagrams for AI learning
- Export to other visualization formats
- Custom diagram templates

### Phase 3 Vision

- Cross-PRD diagram references
- Automated diagram-based test generation

## Conclusion

AI-powered diagram generation will transform how product teams create and maintain documentation. By automatically generating visual representations from written requirements, we eliminate duplicate work, ensure consistency, and make PRDs more accessible to all stakeholders. This feature will become an essential part of the modern PM toolkit, as fundamental as spell-check is to writing.
