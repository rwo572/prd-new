# Product Requirements Document: Integrated Thought Clarifier
## AI-Powered PRD Generator for Prototype-Driven Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
The Integrated Thought Clarifier transforms how product teams move from idea to implementation by treating PRDs as code - versionable, trackable, and directly executable into working prototypes. It bridges the gap between product thinking and prototype generation, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining rigorous documentation standards. **Now optimized for AI-native products** with intelligent linting that ensures critical AI requirements are never missed.

### 1.2 Mission Statement
Enable product managers, founders, designers, and engineers to clarify their product thinking through AI-guided PRD creation that seamlessly translates into working prototypes, fundamentally changing how teams build products.

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Reduce time from idea to working prototype by 80% (from days to hours)
- Achieve 90% stakeholder alignment on first PRD iteration
- Enable 100% traceability of requirement changes through Git history
- Maintain zero data persistence in application (complete privacy)

---

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 Current State Problems

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- Product managers spend 15-20 hours per week on documentation (source: ProductPlan survey 2023)
- 67% of product failures trace back to unclear requirements (Standish Group)
- Average of 4.2 iterations needed before PRD approval in enterprise settings
- 40% of PRDs become outdated within 2 weeks of creation

**Qualitative Pain Points:**
- PRDs live in disconnected tools (Google Docs, Notion, Confluence) without version control
- No direct path from PRD to prototype - manual translation required
- Changes during prototype iteration rarely flow back to PRD documentation
- Collaboration requires context switching between multiple tools
- Privacy concerns with proprietary product ideas in SaaS tools

### 2.2 Target Users

**Primary Personas:**

1. **Startup Founder/Solo PM**
   - Needs: Rapid ideation to prototype, minimal overhead
   - Pain: Time spent on documentation vs. building
   - Value: Speed and privacy for competitive ideas

2. **Product Manager (Tech Company)**
   - Needs: Stakeholder alignment, clear handoff to engineering
   - Pain: Keeping PRDs updated with prototype iterations
   - Value: Git-based workflow, trackable changes

3. **Design Engineer**
   - Needs: Clear specs that translate to code
   - Pain: Ambiguous requirements, missing edge cases
   - Value: Prototype-ready specifications

### 2.3 Why Now?
- AI models (GPT-4, Claude) now capable of understanding complex product requirements
- Prototype generation tools (v0, Cursor, Claude) need well-structured inputs
- Git-based workflows becoming standard across all disciplines
- Privacy concerns driving demand for local-first tools

## 4. Behavioral Contract

### 4.1 AI Personality
- **Tone**: Professional yet approachable, like a senior product manager
- **Style**: Socratic method - asks clarifying questions before suggesting
- **Expertise**: Deep knowledge of product management, software architecture, and UX patterns

### 4.2 Interaction Examples

#### 4.2.1 Good Response
**User**: "I want to build a task management app"
**AI**: "Let's clarify your vision. What makes your task management app different from existing solutions like Asana or Linear? Are you targeting a specific user segment or workflow?"

#### 4.2.2 Better Response  
**User**: "I want to build a task management app"
**AI**: "I'll help you clarify that vision. Let me understand your unique angle:
1. Who is your target user? (Individual/Team/Enterprise)
2. What specific problem does existing tools not solve?
3. What's your core differentiator?

Based on your answers, I'll help structure a PRD optimized for rapid prototyping."

#### 4.2.3 Reject Response
**User**: "Build me a complete app"
**AI**: "I help clarify and document your product thinking, not build the actual application. Let's start by defining what problem your app solves and for whom. Once we have a clear PRD, I can generate prompts for prototype tools like v0 or Cursor."

### 4.3 Decision Trees

```
IF user_input.is_vague:
  → Ask clarifying questions
  → Provide examples
  → Suggest templates

IF user_input.has_conflicts:
  → Highlight contradictions
  → Propose resolutions
  → Document trade-offs

IF user_input.missing_critical_info:
  → Flag gaps
  → Explain importance
  → Provide defaults with warnings

IF user_input.ready_for_prototype:
  → Generate structured PRD
  → Create prompt templates
  → Suggest iteration strategy
```

## 11. Automated Codebase Scanning Methodology

### 11.1 Overview
This section documents the systematic approach for scanning and analyzing the codebase to extract critical requirements. This methodology can be built as a feature within the product to automatically keep PRDs synchronized with actual implementation.

### 11.2 Scanning Process

#### Phase 1: Dependency Analysis
```yaml
Scan Targets:
  - package.json: Dependencies, versions, scripts
  - tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration
  - next.config.js: Framework configuration
  - tailwind.config.js: Design system setup

Extract:
  - Core frameworks and versions
  - Critical dependencies
  - Build configurations
  - Development scripts
```

#### Phase 2: Component Discovery
```yaml
Scan Pattern:
  - /components/**/*.tsx: UI components
  - /app/**/*.tsx: Pages and layouts
  - /lib/**/*.ts: Services and utilities
  - /hooks/**/*.ts: Custom React hooks

Analysis:
  - Component hierarchy mapping
  - Props and state interfaces
  - Component dependencies
  - Feature implementations
```

#### Phase 3: API Route Mapping
```yaml
Scan Location:
  - /app/api/**/route.ts: API endpoints

Document:
  - Endpoint paths and methods
  - Request/response schemas
  - External service integrations
  - Authentication requirements
```

#### Phase 4: Feature Extraction
```yaml
Identify Patterns:
  - Import statements: Used libraries
  - Component names: Feature indicators
  - API calls: Service integrations
  - State management: Data flow

Map to Features:
  - Editor capabilities
  - AI integrations
  - UI interactions
  - Data persistence
```

#### Phase 5: Requirements Inference
```yaml
From Code Patterns:
  - Performance: Lazy loading, memoization
  - Security: API key handling, CORS
  - Compatibility: Polyfills, fallbacks
  - Architecture: Patterns and practices

Generate Requirements:
  - Technical constraints
  - Feature dependencies
  - Performance baselines
  - Security standards
```

### 11.3 Automation Implementation

#### Scanning Service Architecture
```typescript
interface CodebaseScanner {
  scanDependencies(): TechnicalStack
  scanComponents(): ComponentMap
  scanAPIs(): APIEndpoints
  scanFeatures(): FeatureList
  inferRequirements(): Requirements
  generateReport(): PRDUpdate
}
```

#### Integration Points
1. **Git Hooks**: Scan on commit/push
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Validate PRD against code
3. **IDE Plugin**: Real-time PRD updates
4. **Web UI**: Manual scan trigger

### 11.4 PRD Synchronization

#### Automatic Updates
- **New Dependencies**: Add to technical requirements
- **New Components**: Update feature list
- **API Changes**: Modify integration specs
- **Performance Changes**: Update benchmarks

#### Conflict Resolution
- **Code vs PRD**: Flag discrepancies
- **Version Mismatches**: Highlight updates needed
- **Missing Features**: Identify undocumented functionality
- **Deprecated Items**: Mark for removal

### 11.5 Benefits of Automated Scanning

1. **Living Documentation**: PRD always reflects actual implementation
2. **Drift Detection**: Identify when code diverges from spec
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Know exactly what's required
4. **Feature Discovery**: Find undocumented capabilities
5. **Technical Debt**: Identify outdated requirements
