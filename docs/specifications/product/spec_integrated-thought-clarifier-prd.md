# Product Requirements Document: Integrated Thought Clarifier
## AI-Powered PRD Generator for Prototype-Driven Development

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
The Integrated Thought Clarifier transforms how product teams move from idea to implementation by treating PRDs as code - versionable, trackable, and directly executable into working prototypes. It bridges the gap between product thinking and prototype generation, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining rigorous documentation standards.

### 1.2 Mission Statement
Enable product managers, founders, designers, and engineers to clarify their product thinking through AI-guided PRD creation that seamlessly translates into working prototypes, fundamentally changing how teams build products.

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Reduce time from idea to working prototype by 80% (from days to hours)
- Achieve 90% stakeholder alignment on first PRD iteration
- Enable 100% traceability of requirement changes through Git history
- Maintain zero data persistence in application (complete privacy)

---

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 Current State Problems

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- Product managers spend 15-20 hours per week on documentation (source: ProductPlan survey 2023)
- 67% of product failures trace back to unclear requirements (Standish Group)
- Average of 4.2 iterations needed before PRD approval in enterprise settings
- 40% of PRDs become outdated within 2 weeks of creation

**Qualitative Pain Points:**
- PRDs live in disconnected tools (Google Docs, Notion, Confluence) without version control
- No direct path from PRD to prototype - manual translation required
- Changes during prototype iteration rarely flow back to PRD documentation
- Collaboration requires context switching between multiple tools
- Privacy concerns with proprietary product ideas in SaaS tools

### 2.2 Target Users

**Primary Personas:**

1. **Startup Founder/Solo PM**
   - Needs: Rapid ideation to prototype, minimal overhead
   - Pain: Time spent on documentation vs. building
   - Value: Speed and privacy for competitive ideas

2. **Product Manager (Tech Company)**
   - Needs: Stakeholder alignment, clear handoff to engineering
   - Pain: Keeping PRDs updated with prototype iterations
   - Value: Git-based workflow, trackable changes

3. **Design Engineer**
   - Needs: Clear specs that translate to code
   - Pain: Ambiguous requirements, missing edge cases
   - Value: Prototype-ready specifications

### 2.3 Why Now?
- AI models (GPT-4, Claude) now capable of understanding complex product requirements
- Prototype generation tools (v0, Cursor, Claude) need well-structured inputs
- Git-based workflows becoming standard across all disciplines
- Privacy concerns driving demand for local-first tools

## 3. Solution Design

### 3.1 Core Concept
An AI-powered tool that guides users through structured thought clarification to produce Git-managed, markdown-based PRDs optimized for feeding into AI prototype generators.

### 3.2 Key Capabilities

#### 3.2.1 Intelligent PRD Generation
- **Conversational Discovery**: AI asks targeted questions to uncover hidden requirements
- **Template Intelligence**: Adapts templates based on product type (B2B SaaS, Consumer App, AI Product, etc.)
- **Requirement Extraction**: Identifies functional, non-functional, and edge case requirements
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Flags vague or conflicting requirements for clarification

#### 3.2.2 Git-Native Workflow
- **Repository per PRD**: Each PRD gets its own GitHub repository
- **Branching for Iterations**: Feature branches for different prototype iterations
- **Commit Messages**: AI generates meaningful commit messages explaining requirement changes
- **Pull Request Templates**: Structured review process for PRD changes

#### 3.2.3 Prototype-Ready Output
- **Structured Markdown**: Consistent schema optimized for AI consumption
- **Component Specifications**: UI components, state management, data flow
- **Acceptance Criteria**: BDD-style criteria for validation
- **Prompt Templates**: Generated prompts for v0, Cursor, Claude, etc.

#### 3.2.4 AI-Powered Prototype Generation
- **One-Click Generation**: Transform PRD directly into working prototype code
- **Visual Simplicity**: Progressive disclosure from wireframe to styled to interactive
- **Smart Defaults**: AI auto-detects product type and applies appropriate patterns
- **Natural Language Refinement**: Modify prototypes with commands like "make it more colorful"
- **Multi-Format Export**: React, HTML/CSS, or framework-specific code

#### 3.2.5 Privacy-First Architecture
- **Zero Data Retention**: No user data stored in application
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Users provide their own OpenAI/Anthropic API keys
- **Local Storage Option**: PRDs can be saved locally or pushed to user's GitHub
- **Client-Side Processing**: All AI interactions happen client-side

### 3.3 User Flow

```
1. INITIATE
   User logs in via GitHub OAuth → New repo created

## 4. Behavioral Contract

### 4.1 AI Personality
- **Tone**: Professional yet approachable, like a senior product manager
- **Style**: Socratic method - asks clarifying questions before suggesting
- **Expertise**: Deep knowledge of product management, software architecture, and UX patterns

### 4.2 Interaction Examples

#### 4.2.1 Good Response
**User**: "I want to build a task management app"
**AI**: "Let's clarify your vision. What makes your task management app different from existing solutions like Asana or Linear? Are you targeting a specific user segment or workflow?"

#### 4.2.2 Better Response  
**User**: "I want to build a task management app"
**AI**: "I'll help you clarify that vision. Let me understand your unique angle:
1. Who is your target user? (Individual/Team/Enterprise)
2. What specific problem does existing tools not solve?
3. What's your core differentiator?

Based on your answers, I'll help structure a PRD optimized for rapid prototyping."

#### 4.2.3 Reject Response
**User**: "Build me a complete app"
**AI**: "I help clarify and document your product thinking, not build the actual application. Let's start by defining what problem your app solves and for whom. Once we have a clear PRD, I can generate prompts for prototype tools like v0 or Cursor."

### 4.3 Decision Trees

```
IF user_input.is_vague:
  → Ask clarifying questions
  → Provide examples
  → Suggest templates

IF user_input.has_conflicts:
  → Highlight contradictions
  → Propose resolutions
  → Document trade-offs

IF user_input.missing_critical_info:
  → Flag gaps
  → Explain importance
  → Provide defaults with warnings

IF user_input.ready_for_prototype:
  → Generate structured PRD
  → Create prompt templates
  → Suggest iteration strategy
```
