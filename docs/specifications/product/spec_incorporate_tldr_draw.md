# PRD: Incorporating tldraw into MDX-based Interactive PRD System

## Executive Summary

### Overview
This PRD outlines the integration of the existing tldraw canvas application into the MDX-based Interactive PRD system, creating a seamless workflow from visual ideation to executable specifications.

### Value Proposition
By incorporating tldraw as a first-class component in MDX PRDs, product teams can:
- Sketch ideas visually and convert them directly to React components
- Annotate live components with visual markup
- Collaborate on brainstorming within the PRD document
- Generate acceptance criteria from user flows
- Maintain full traceability from sketch to implementation

### Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in design-to-code handoff time
- 80% of wireframes successfully converted to working components
- 90% user satisfaction with integrated workflow
- 100% of visual artifacts version-controlled with PRDs

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- tldraw exists as a standalone canvas application with AI generation
- PRDs are text-based with limited visual representation
- Wireframes and prototypes live separately from specifications
- Manual translation required from sketches to components
- Visual annotations are static images, not interactive

### Pain Points
1. **Context Switching**: PMs switch between multiple tools for ideation, documentation, and prototyping
2. **Lost in Translation**: Visual ideas lose fidelity when converted to text specifications
3. **Synchronization Issues**: Wireframes and PRDs drift out of sync
4. **Limited Collaboration**: Visual brainstorming happens outside the PRD workflow
5. **No Traceability**: Can't track from initial sketch to final implementation

### Opportunity
Create an integrated environment where visual thinking and specification writing happen together, with AI assistance throughout the process.

## Solution Design

### 1. Core Integration Components

#### 1.1 TldrawEmbed Component
A reusable React component that embeds tldraw canvas within MDX documents.

```typescript
interface TldrawEmbedProps {
  // Canvas configuration
  height?: number | string
  tools?: TldrawTool[]
  readOnly?: boolean
  
  // Data flow
  initialShapes?: TLShape[]
  onShapesChange?: (shapes: TLShape[]) => void
  onExport?: (data: ExportData) => void
  
  // AI integration
  enableAI?: boolean
  apiKey?: string
  systemPrompt?: string
}
```

#### 1.2 MDX Component Library

**Wireframe Component**
```markdown
<Wireframe 
  id="dashboard-layout"
  prompt="Create a dashboard with metrics and charts"
  onGenerate={(shapes) => generateComponents(shapes)}
/>
```

**Visual Annotation Component**
```markdown
<VisualAnnotation allowDrawing={true}>
  <DashboardComponent />
</VisualAnnotation>
```

**Brainstorming Component**
```markdown
<Brainstorm 
  topic="User onboarding improvements"
  participants={["PM", "Designer", "Engineers"]}
  onExport={(ideas) => convertToUserStories(ideas)}
/>
```

**Flow Diagram Component**
```markdown
<FlowDiagram 
  type="user-flow"
  title="Purchase flow"
  onAnalyze={(flow) => generateAcceptanceCriteria(flow)}
/>
```

### 2. Shape-to-Component AI Pipeline

#### 2.1 Shape Analysis
```typescript
interface ShapeAnalyzer {
  identifyUIPatterns(shapes: TLShape[]): UIPattern[]
  extractLayout(shapes: TLShape[]): LayoutStructure
  inferComponents(patterns: UIPattern[]): ComponentSpec[]
}
```

#### 2.2 Component Generation
```typescript
interface ComponentGenerator {
  generateReactCode(spec: ComponentSpec): string
  generateProps(shapes: TLShape[]): PropDefinitions
  generateStyles(layout: LayoutStructure): StyleDefinitions
  generateTests(spec: ComponentSpec): TestSuite
}
```

#### 2.3 Schema Extraction
```typescript
interface SchemaExtractor {
  fromShapes(shapes: TLShape[]): DataSchema
  fromAnnotations(pins: Pin[]): ValidationRules
  fromUserFlow(flow: FlowDiagram): StateTransitions
}
```

### 3. Workflow Integration

#### 3.1 Sketch → Component Flow
1. PM sketches wireframe in tldraw
2. AI analyzes shapes and suggests components
3. PM refines and approves suggestions
4. System generates React component code
5. Component appears in live preview
6. PM adds annotations and acceptance criteria

#### 3.2 Annotation → Documentation Flow
1. PM draws annotations on live component
2. Annotations convert to structured pins
3. Pins generate API contracts and validation rules
4. Documentation updates automatically

#### 3.3 Brainstorm → Requirements Flow
1. Team collaborates on tldraw canvas
2. Ideas organized into themes
3. AI converts themes to user stories
4. User stories generate acceptance criteria
5. Criteria link to component tests

### 4. Data Models

#### 4.1 Enhanced PRD Document
```typescript
interface PRDDocument {
  // Existing fields...
  visualArtifacts: {
    wireframes: WireframeSnapshot[]
    annotations: AnnotationLayer[]
    flows: FlowDiagram[]
    brainstorms: BrainstormSession[]
  }
  shapeToComponentMappings: {
    [shapeId: string]: {
      componentId: string
      generatedCode: string
      confidence: number
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4.2 Visual Artifact Storage
```typescript
interface WireframeSnapshot {
  id: string
  timestamp: Date
  shapes: TLShape[]
  thumbnail: string // base64
  generatedComponents: string[] // component IDs
}

interface AnnotationLayer {
  targetComponent: string
  shapes: TLShape[]
  extractedRequirements: Requirement[]
}
```
