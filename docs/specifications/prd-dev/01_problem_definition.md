# Problem Definition

## Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
prd-dev transforms how product teams move from idea to implementation by treating PRDs as code - versionable, trackable, and directly executable into working prototypes. It bridges the gap between product thinking and prototype generation, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining rigorous documentation standards. **Now optimized for AI-native products** with intelligent linting that ensures critical AI requirements are never missed.

### 1.2 Mission Statement
Enable product managers, founders, designers, and engineers to clarify their product thinking through AI-guided PRD creation that seamlessly translates into working prototypes, fundamentally changing how teams build products.

## Problem Definition

### 2.1 Core Problem Statement

Product teams face a critical disconnect between product requirements and prototype development. PRDs exist in isolation from implementation, leading to:

- **Translation Friction**: Manual conversion from requirements to working code
- **Documentation Debt**: PRDs become outdated during prototype iterations
- **Context Switching**: Multiple tools required for documentation, collaboration, and prototyping
- **Privacy Concerns**: Proprietary ideas exposed in SaaS documentation platforms

### 2.2 Problem Evidence

#### Quantitative Evidence
- Product managers spend **15-20 hours per week** on documentation (ProductPlan survey 2023)
- **67% of product failures** trace back to unclear requirements (Standish Group)
- Average of **4.2 iterations** needed before PRD approval in enterprise settings
- **40% of PRDs** become outdated within 2 weeks of creation
- **80% increase** in time from idea to prototype due to manual translation steps

#### Qualitative Pain Points
- PRDs live in disconnected tools (Google Docs, Notion, Confluence) without version control
- No direct path from PRD to prototype - manual translation required
- Changes during prototype iteration rarely flow back to PRD documentation
- Collaboration requires context switching between multiple tools
- Privacy concerns with proprietary product ideas in SaaS tools
- Ambiguous requirements lead to misaligned prototypes
- Stakeholder feedback loops are slow and disconnected from source documentation

### 2.3 Target User Problems

#### Primary Personas & Their Pain Points

**1. Startup Founder/Solo PM**
- **Core Problem**: Time spent on documentation vs. building reduces competitive velocity
- **Current Struggle**: Needs rapid ideation to prototype with minimal overhead
- **Gap**: No tool bridges strategic thinking to executable prototype
- **Privacy Need**: Competitive ideas require secure, local-first documentation

**2. Product Manager (Tech Company)**
- **Core Problem**: Stakeholder alignment breaks down between PRD and implementation
- **Current Struggle**: Keeping PRDs updated with prototype iterations is manual and error-prone
- **Gap**: No Git-based workflow for product requirements like engineering has for code
- **Collaboration Need**: Clear handoff process to engineering teams

**3. Design Engineer**
- **Core Problem**: Ambiguous requirements lead to implementation uncertainty
- **Current Struggle**: Missing edge cases and unclear specifications cause rework
- **Gap**: PRDs don't translate directly to development-ready specifications
- **Technical Need**: Prototype-ready specifications with clear acceptance criteria

### 2.4 Why Now? (Market Timing)

#### Technology Enablers
- **AI Capability Maturity**: GPT-4 and Claude now capable of understanding complex product requirements and generating working code
- **Prototype Generation Tools**: v0, Cursor, and Claude require well-structured inputs that current PRDs don't provide
- **Git-Native Workflows**: Version control becoming standard across all disciplines, not just engineering
- **Browser-Based Development**: WebContainer and similar technologies enable full development environments in browsers

#### Market Shifts
- **Privacy-First Demand**: Increasing concerns about proprietary ideas in SaaS tools driving demand for local-first solutions
- **AI-Native Products**: 80% of new products incorporating AI features require specialized documentation approaches
- **Remote Collaboration**: Distributed teams need better async collaboration tools that maintain context
- **Speed-to-Market Pressure**: Competitive landscapes require faster ideation-to-prototype cycles

### 2.5 Problem Constraints

#### Technical Constraints
- **API Dependencies**: Reliance on OpenAI/Anthropic API availability and rate limits
- **Browser Limitations**: WebContainer technology requires modern browsers with specific capabilities
- **Context Limits**: LLM token limits constrain PRD size and conversation length
- **Client-Side Processing**: Privacy requirements limit server-side optimization opportunities

#### User Constraints
- **Learning Curve**: Users need to adapt to Git-based workflow for documentation
- **API Key Management**: Users must manage their own AI service API keys
- **Technical Literacy**: Prototype generation requires understanding of web development concepts
- **Collaboration Limits**: Local-first approach initially limits real-time multi-user editing

#### Business Constraints
- **Zero Revenue Window**: Privacy-first architecture prevents typical SaaS monetization until premium features
- **Support Complexity**: Debugging issues across multiple AI services and local storage
- **Competitive Timing**: Established players may launch similar solutions rapidly

#### Market Constraints
- **Adoption Friction**: Product teams need to change established documentation workflows
- **Integration Requirements**: Must work with existing tools (Figma, Jira, Linear) for enterprise adoption
- **Compliance Needs**: Enterprise customers require security audits and compliance certifications

### 2.6 Success Criteria for Problem Resolution

#### Primary Success Metrics
- Reduce time from idea to working prototype by **80%** (from days to hours)
- Achieve **90% stakeholder alignment** on first PRD iteration
- Enable **100% traceability** of requirement changes through Git history
- Maintain **zero data persistence** in application (complete privacy)

#### User Experience Success
- Generate complete PRD in **<2 hours** (vs. current 8-16 hours)
- PRD-to-prototype generation in **<10 seconds**
- **95%+ prototype compilation** success rate without manual fixes
- **<4 hour** total time from initial idea to stakeholder-approved prototype

#### Quality Indicators
- **>90%** requirement completeness score via AI linting
- **>95%** ambiguity detection rate in requirements
- **>80%** prototype acceptance rate by stakeholders
- **<2%** error rate in AI-generated specifications

## Market Context

### 3.1 Current Market Gap

The market has tools for documentation (Notion, Confluence), design (Figma), and prototyping (v0, Cursor), but no solution that:
- Treats product requirements as code with version control
- Directly translates requirements to working prototypes
- Maintains privacy through local-first architecture
- Provides AI-powered quality assurance for requirements

### 3.2 Competitive Landscape Position

- **GitHub Copilot**: Code-focused, not product requirements
- **Notion AI**: General purpose, not prototype-optimized
- **ProductPlan**: Traditional PRD, no AI or prototype connection
- **Unique Position**: Only tool bridging PRD to prototype with Git-native workflow and AI-powered quality assurance

### 3.3 Market Opportunity Size

**Immediate Addressable Market**:
- 500K+ product managers globally
- 2M+ technical founders and design engineers
- 50K+ companies building AI-native products

**Problem Validation Indicators**:
- 15+ hours/week spent on documentation per PM
- $2B+ market for product management tools
- 300%+ growth in AI-powered development tools
