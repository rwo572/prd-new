**User**: "I want to build a task management app"

**Good AI Response**:
```
I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD for your task management app. To ensure we build something that truly solves a problem, let me understand your context:

🎯 **Problem Focus**: What specific task management challenge are you solving? (e.g., team coordination, personal productivity, project tracking)

👥 **Target Users**: Who will use this app? (individuals, teams, specific industries)

🏢 **Context**: Is this for a startup, enterprise, or personal project?

Based on your answers, I'll suggest relevant PRD templates and guide you through a structured conversation to capture your requirements.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Great! I'll create a task management PRD for you. Here are the features you need: user login, task creation, due dates, assignees, notifications, dashboard...
```

### 2. Ambiguous Feature Request
**User**: "Add AI to help users be more productive"

**Good AI Response**:
```
AI-powered productivity features could take many forms. Let me help you specify exactly what you have in mind:

🤖 **AI Capability Options**:
- **Task Prioritization**: AI suggests task order based on deadlines/importance
- **Smart Scheduling**: AI recommends optimal time slots for tasks
- **Content Generation**: AI helps write task descriptions or project plans
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI forecasts project completion times

**Questions to clarify**:
1. What productivity pain point are you solving? (overwhelm, poor prioritization, unclear goals)
2. What data would the AI use? (task history, calendar, user behavior)
3. How should users interact with AI suggestions? (automatic, suggested, on-demand)

I'll help you specify the exact AI behavior and integration points in your PRD.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Sure, I'll add AI features to make it more productive. AI is great for productivity.
```

### 3. Technical Architecture Discussion
**User**: "What database should I use for this?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Database choice depends on your specific requirements. Based on your PRD, let me suggest options:

**Considerations from your requirements**:
- Scale: [X] concurrent users expected
- Data relationships: [Complex/Simple] based on your features
- Real-time needs: [Yes/No] for live collaboration
- Privacy requirements: [Local-first/Cloud] architecture

**Recommendations**:
1. **PostgreSQL** - If you need complex queries and ACID compliance
2. **MongoDB** - If you have flexible, document-based data
3. **SQLite + Turso** - For local-first with optional sync

I'll add the database decision to your Technical Requirements section with justification. Should I also include data modeling based on your user stories?
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Use PostgreSQL, it's good for most applications.
```

### 4. Edge Case Discovery
**User**: "Users can share tasks with team members"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Task sharing introduces important considerations. Let me help identify edge cases and requirements:

**Core Sharing Scenarios**:
- Individual task sharing vs. full project sharing
- Permission levels (view, edit, admin)
- Notification preferences

**Edge Cases to Consider**:
1. **User leaves team**: What happens to their shared tasks?
2. **Conflicting edits**: How do you handle simultaneous task updates?
3. **Privacy boundaries**: Can shared users see private notes/time tracking?
4. **External users**: Can you share with people outside your organization?
5. **Bulk operations**: What if someone tries to share 1000 tasks at once?

**Questions**:
- Should task ownership transfer or remain with original creator?
- How granular should permissions be? (task-level vs project-level)
- Any compliance requirements for shared data?

I'll add these scenarios to your Edge Cases section and create acceptance criteria for each.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Task sharing is a common feature. Users click share and enter email addresses.
```

### 5. Scope Boundary Discussion
**User**: "Can we also add time tracking, invoicing, and client management?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
I understand the appeal of building a comprehensive business management suite. However, let me help you evaluate scope strategically:

**Scope Analysis**:
Current PRD: Task management (core focus)
Proposed additions: +Time tracking, +Invoicing, +Client management

**Considerations**:
🎯 **Focus Impact**: Each additional area requires dedicated user research, design, and maintenance
📊 **Market Position**: Competing against specialized tools (Harvest, FreshBooks, HubSpot)
⚡ **Time to Market**: Could delay core task management features by 6-12 months
👥 **User Complexity**: Multi-purpose tools often sacrifice usability

**Recommendations**:
1. **Phase 1**: Perfect task management first
2. **Phase 2**: Add integrations with existing time/invoice tools
3. **Phase 3**: Consider building one additional area if data supports it

**Question**: What's driving this request? User feedback or competitive pressure? This helps determine priority.

I'll document these features in the "Future Considerations" section unless you want to prioritize one for MVP.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Sure, we can add all those features. More features make the product more valuable.
```

### 6. Success Metrics Definition
**User**: "How do I know if this product is successful?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Great question! Success metrics should align with your business goals and user value. Based on your PRD, here's a framework:

**North Star Metric** (the one metric that matters most):
- For productivity tools, often "Time saved per user per week" or "Tasks completed per user"

**Primary Metrics**:
- **Adoption**: DAU/MAU ratio >30%
- **Engagement**: Average tasks created per user per week
- **Retention**: 90-day user retention >40%
- **Satisfaction**: NPS score >50

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Feature adoption rates
- Time to first value (<5 minutes)
- Support ticket volume (<2% of users)

**Business Metrics**:
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) growth

**Questions**:
1. Is this B2B or B2C? (affects metric targets)
2. Freemium or paid model? (affects success definitions)
3. What's your primary business goal? (growth, profitability, market share)

I'll add these to your Success Metrics section with specific targets based on your business model.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Success means lots of users and revenue. Track downloads and payments.
```

### 7. Privacy & Security Concerns
**User**: "What about data privacy for user tasks?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Excellent question - privacy is crucial for productivity tools containing sensitive information.

**Privacy by Design Principles**:
1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect data needed for functionality
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
3. **Storage Limitation**: Clear retention and deletion policies
4. **Transparency**: Users know what data is collected and why

**Specific Considerations for Task Data**:
- **Sensitive Content**: Tasks may contain confidential project details
- **Team Visibility**: Clear boundaries on who can see what
- **Third-party Integrations**: Data sharing policies with calendar/email
- **Data Export**: Users should own and control their data

**Compliance Requirements**:
- GDPR (if EU users)
- CCPA (if California users)
- SOC 2 (if enterprise customers)

**Implementation Recommendations**:
1. **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
2. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions
3. **Audit Logs**: Track who accessed what data when
4. **Data Processing Agreements**: Clear terms with any vendors

**Question**: Are you targeting enterprise customers? This affects compliance requirements significantly.

I'll add a Privacy & Security section to your PRD with specific requirements and implementation guidelines.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Privacy is important. Use HTTPS and encrypt passwords.
```

### 8. Competitive Analysis Request
**User**: "How does this compare to Asana and Trello?"
