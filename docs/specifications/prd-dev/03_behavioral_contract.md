## Response Examples (10+ Scenarios)

### 1. Initial PRD Creation
**User**: "I want to build a task management app"

**Good AI Response**:
```
I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD for your task management app. To ensure we build something that truly solves a problem, let me understand your context:

🎯 **Problem Focus**: What specific task management challenge are you solving? (e.g., team coordination, personal productivity, project tracking)

👥 **Target Users**: Who will use this app? (individuals, teams, specific industries)

🏢 **Context**: Is this for a startup, enterprise, or personal project?

Based on your answers, I'll suggest relevant PRD templates and guide you through a structured conversation to capture your requirements.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Great! I'll create a task management PRD for you. Here are the features you need: user login, task creation, due dates, assignees, notifications, dashboard...
```

### 2. Ambiguous Feature Request
**User**: "Add AI to help users be more productive"

**Good AI Response**:
```
AI-powered productivity features could take many forms. Let me help you specify exactly what you have in mind:

🤖 **AI Capability Options**:
- **Task Prioritization**: AI suggests task order based on deadlines/importance
- **Smart Scheduling**: AI recommends optimal time slots for tasks
- **Content Generation**: AI helps write task descriptions or project plans
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI forecasts project completion times

**Questions to clarify**:
1. What productivity pain point are you solving? (overwhelm, poor prioritization, unclear goals)
2. What data would the AI use? (task history, calendar, user behavior)
3. How should users interact with AI suggestions? (automatic, suggested, on-demand)

I'll help you specify the exact AI behavior and integration points in your PRD.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Sure, I'll add AI features to make it more productive. AI is great for productivity.
```

### 3. Technical Architecture Discussion
**User**: "What database should I use for this?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Database choice depends on your specific requirements. Based on your PRD, let me suggest options:

**Considerations from your requirements**:
- Scale: [X] concurrent users expected
- Data relationships: [Complex/Simple] based on your features
- Real-time needs: [Yes/No] for live collaboration
- Privacy requirements: [Local-first/Cloud] architecture

**Recommendations**:
1. **PostgreSQL** - If you need complex queries and ACID compliance
2. **MongoDB** - If you have flexible, document-based data
3. **SQLite + Turso** - For local-first with optional sync

I'll add the database decision to your Technical Requirements section with justification. Should I also include data modeling based on your user stories?
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Use PostgreSQL, it's good for most applications.
```

### 4. Edge Case Discovery
**User**: "Users can share tasks with team members"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Task sharing introduces important considerations. Let me help identify edge cases and requirements:

**Core Sharing Scenarios**:
- Individual task sharing vs. full project sharing
- Permission levels (view, edit, admin)
- Notification preferences

**Edge Cases to Consider**:
1. **User leaves team**: What happens to their shared tasks?
2. **Conflicting edits**: How do you handle simultaneous task updates?
3. **Privacy boundaries**: Can shared users see private notes/time tracking?
4. **External users**: Can you share with people outside your organization?
5. **Bulk operations**: What if someone tries to share 1000 tasks at once?

**Questions**:
- Should task ownership transfer or remain with original creator?
- How granular should permissions be? (task-level vs project-level)
- Any compliance requirements for shared data?

I'll add these scenarios to your Edge Cases section and create acceptance criteria for each.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Task sharing is a common feature. Users click share and enter email addresses.
```

### 5. Scope Boundary Discussion
**User**: "Can we also add time tracking, invoicing, and client management?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
I understand the appeal of building a comprehensive business management suite. However, let me help you evaluate scope strategically:

**Scope Analysis**:
Current PRD: Task management (core focus)
Proposed additions: +Time tracking, +Invoicing, +Client management

**Considerations**:
🎯 **Focus Impact**: Each additional area requires dedicated user research, design, and maintenance
📊 **Market Position**: Competing against specialized tools (Harvest, FreshBooks, HubSpot)
⚡ **Time to Market**: Could delay core task management features by 6-12 months
👥 **User Complexity**: Multi-purpose tools often sacrifice usability

**Recommendations**:
1. **Phase 1**: Perfect task management first
2. **Phase 2**: Add integrations with existing time/invoice tools
3. **Phase 3**: Consider building one additional area if data supports it

**Question**: What's driving this request? User feedback or competitive pressure? This helps determine priority.

I'll document these features in the "Future Considerations" section unless you want to prioritize one for MVP.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Sure, we can add all those features. More features make the product more valuable.
```

### 6. Success Metrics Definition
**User**: "How do I know if this product is successful?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Great question! Success metrics should align with your business goals and user value. Based on your PRD, here's a framework:

**North Star Metric** (the one metric that matters most):
- For productivity tools, often "Time saved per user per week" or "Tasks completed per user"

**Primary Metrics**:
- **Adoption**: DAU/MAU ratio >30%
- **Engagement**: Average tasks created per user per week
- **Retention**: 90-day user retention >40%
- **Satisfaction**: NPS score >50

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Feature adoption rates
- Time to first value (<5 minutes)
- Support ticket volume (<2% of users)

**Business Metrics**:
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) growth

**Questions**:
1. Is this B2B or B2C? (affects metric targets)
2. Freemium or paid model? (affects success definitions)
3. What's your primary business goal? (growth, profitability, market share)

I'll add these to your Success Metrics section with specific targets based on your business model.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Success means lots of users and revenue. Track downloads and payments.
```

### 7. Privacy & Security Concerns
**User**: "What about data privacy for user tasks?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Excellent question - privacy is crucial for productivity tools containing sensitive information.

**Privacy by Design Principles**:
1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect data needed for functionality
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
3. **Storage Limitation**: Clear retention and deletion policies
4. **Transparency**: Users know what data is collected and why

**Specific Considerations for Task Data**:
- **Sensitive Content**: Tasks may contain confidential project details
- **Team Visibility**: Clear boundaries on who can see what
- **Third-party Integrations**: Data sharing policies with calendar/email
- **Data Export**: Users should own and control their data

**Compliance Requirements**:
- GDPR (if EU users)
- CCPA (if California users)
- SOC 2 (if enterprise customers)

**Implementation Recommendations**:
1. **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
2. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions
3. **Audit Logs**: Track who accessed what data when
4. **Data Processing Agreements**: Clear terms with any vendors

**Question**: Are you targeting enterprise customers? This affects compliance requirements significantly.

I'll add a Privacy & Security section to your PRD with specific requirements and implementation guidelines.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Privacy is important. Use HTTPS and encrypt passwords.
```

### 8. Competitive Analysis Request
**User**: "How does this compare to Asana and Trello?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Great competitive analysis question. Let me break down how your task management app would differentiate:

**Competitive Positioning Analysis**:

**Asana**:
- *Strengths*: Robust project management, team collaboration, enterprise features
- *Weaknesses*: Complex UI, overwhelming for simple use cases, expensive scaling
- *Your Differentiation*: [Based on your PRD] Simpler interface focused on [your unique value prop]

**Trello**:
- *Strengths*: Simple Kanban boards, visual workflow, easy onboarding
- *Weaknesses*: Limited reporting, doesn't scale well for complex projects
- *Your Differentiation*: [Based on your PRD] Enhanced automation and AI features

**Unique Positioning Opportunities**:
1. **AI-First Approach**: If your app includes smart prioritization/scheduling
2. **Privacy Focus**: If you're local-first or have superior data controls
3. **Industry Specialization**: If targeting specific verticals (healthcare, legal, etc.)
4. **Integration Strategy**: If you have unique connectivity to other tools

**Questions to Refine Positioning**:
- What's your primary differentiator from these tools?
- Are you targeting users frustrated with existing solutions?
- What would make someone switch from their current tool?

I'll add this competitive analysis to your Market Context section and ensure your feature prioritization addresses competitive gaps.
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Asana and Trello are good but your app will be better with more features.
```

### 9. Technical Implementation Uncertainty
**User**: "I'm not sure about the technical implementation"

**Good AI Response**:
```
That's completely normal! Technical uncertainty is common in early PRD stages. Let me help clarify what we need to define vs. what can be decided during implementation.

**PRD-Level Technical Decisions** (needed now):
- **Architecture Pattern**: Client-server, local-first, or hybrid
- **Platform Strategy**: Web, mobile, desktop, or multi-platform
- **Integration Requirements**: Which external services must connect
- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, offline capability, scale needs
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, data protection, compliance needs

**Implementation-Level Decisions** (can be decided later):
- Specific database choice
- Frontend framework selection
- Hosting provider details
- Detailed API design

**Questions to Clarify Requirements**:
1. **Users**: How many concurrent users do you expect?
2. **Offline**: Do users need to work without internet?
3. **Real-time**: Do teams need live collaboration features?
4. **Mobile**: Is mobile access required or nice-to-have?
5. **Integrations**: Which external tools must connect?

**Next Steps**:
I'll help you define the technical requirements that affect user experience and business goals. Implementation specifics can be determined by your development team using these requirements.

Would you like me to create a Technical Requirements section focused on user-facing capabilities rather than implementation details?
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
Don't worry about technical details in the PRD. Developers will figure it out.
```

### 10. Validation and Testing Discussion
**User**: "How do I test if this PRD is complete?"

**Good AI Response**:
```
Excellent question! PRD validation is crucial before development begins. Here's a systematic approach:

**Completeness Checklist**:
✅ **Problem Definition**: Clear problem statement with evidence
✅ **User Stories**: Cover all user types and primary workflows
✅ **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes defined
✅ **Technical Requirements**: Non-functional requirements specified
✅ **Edge Cases**: Failure scenarios and error handling covered

**Validation Methods**:

1. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Engineering: Can they estimate and build from this?
   - Design: Are user flows and interactions clear?
   - Business: Do success metrics align with goals?
   - Users: Does this solve their actual problems?

2. **User Story Validation**:
   - Can you walk through each user story end-to-end?
   - Are acceptance criteria testable and specific?
   - Do edge cases have defined behaviors?

3. **Technical Feasibility**:
   - Are performance requirements realistic?
   - Are integrations technically possible?
   - Is the timeline achievable with proposed scope?

**PRD Quality Score**: Our built-in linter will analyze your PRD for:
- Requirement completeness (40+ criteria)
- Ambiguity detection
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Unclear success metrics

**Next Steps**:
1. Run the PRD through our quality linter
2. Schedule stakeholder review sessions
3. Consider user prototype testing for key flows

Would you like me to generate a review checklist specific to your PRD?
```

**Poor AI Response**:
```
The PRD looks good if it has all the sections filled out. Get someone to review it.
```

## PRD Generation Engine Rules

### Overview
The multi-file editor includes an AI-powered PRD generation engine that creates comprehensive, stage-appropriate specifications. These rules define how the engine behaves, what questions it asks, and how it structures output.

---

### 1. Stage-First Architecture

**Principle**: Product stage determines everything else - structure, questions, metrics, focus areas.

**Always ask about stage first**:
- **0→1 (Discovery)**: Creating something new, validating assumptions
- **1→n (Scaling)**: Growing an existing product, expanding reach
- **n^x (Optimization)**: Refining mature product, achieving competitive differentiation

**Stage Detection Keywords**:
```
0→1: "new", "mvp", "prototype", "0 to 1", "0→1", "idea", "validate"
1→n: "scale", "grow", "expand", "1 to n", "1→n", "traction"
n^x: "optimize", "improve", "enhance", "mature", "n^x", "competitive"
```

**Impact**: Stage selection triggers different:
- PRD templates (13 modular files)
- Question sequences
- Metric priorities
- Timeline expectations
- Resource requirements

---

### 2. Minimal Question Flow

**Principle**: Maximum 2-3 questions before generating. Get to value fast.

**Question Sequence**:
1. **Stage Question** (required): "What stage is your product at?"
2. **Context Question** (stage-specific): Problem/opportunity/optimization focus
3. **Refinement Question** (optional): One follow-up for clarity

**Stop Rule**: Generate PRD on 3rd interaction, no exceptions.

**Anti-Pattern**: ❌ Don't create "interview fatigue" with 10+ questions

**Stage-Specific Follow-ups**:

**0→1 Questions**:
- "What core problem are you solving that hasn't been solved before?"
- "Who is your beachhead customer segment?"
- "What's your riskiest assumption to validate?"

**1→n Questions**:
- "What's currently working that you want to scale?"
- "What are your growth bottlenecks?"
- "What's your target growth metric?"

**n^x Questions**:
- "What optimization metric are you targeting?"
- "What's your competitive differentiation?"
- "How much improvement would be meaningful?"

---

### 3. Context Extraction from Messages

**Principle**: Extract implicit information from user messages to reduce explicit questions.

**Auto-Detect Patterns**:

**AI Capability Type**:
- Generation: "generate", "create", "write", "compose"
- Classification: "classify", "categorize", "detect", "identify"
- Recommendation: "recommend", "suggest", "personalize"
- Analysis: "analyze", "insight", "understand", "explain"

**User Sophistication**:
- Consumers: "customer", "consumer", "user", "people"
- Business: "business", "enterprise", "organization", "company"
- Technical: "developer", "engineer", "technical", "API"

**Success Metric Focus**:
- Accuracy: "accurate", "correct", "precise", "reliable"
- Speed: "fast", "quick", "real-time", "instant"
- Cost: "cheap", "affordable", "budget", "cost-effective"
- Satisfaction: "delight", "love", "happy", "satisfied"

**Example**:
```
Input: "Building an AI tool to help developers analyze code faster"
Extracted:
- AI capability: Analysis
- Target user: Technical users (developers)
- Success metric: Speed ("faster")
- Context: Developer tools
```

4. Safety, Edge Cases, Quality (robustness)
5. Technical, Implementation, Operations (execution)
6. Cost/Timeline (business planning)

---

### 6. Content Structure Per File

**Markdown Formatting Standards**:
- Clear H2/H3 hierarchy
- Tables for structured data
- Checklists for actionable items
- Examples with ✅ Good, ❌ Bad, 🚫 Reject patterns
- Reference links to source guidelines

**Progressive Disclosure**:
- Start with placeholder: `## Coming Soon\n\nContent for this section will be loaded...`
- Populate core sections first (Problem, Solution, Behavioral)
- Allow incremental refinement through chat
- Maintain "Last Updated" timestamps

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
# 01_problem_definition.md

## Core Problem Statement
> [One clear sentence]

## Problem Evidence

### Quantitative Evidence
| Metric | Current State | Source | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Qualitative Evidence
- **User Quote 1**: "[actual quote]" - [User Type, Date]

## Why Now?
- [ ] New technology enablement
- [ ] Market shift
...
```

---

### 7. AI-Specific Requirements

**When generating AI product specs, include**:

**Behavioral Examples (5-10 minimum)**:
```markdown
### Example 1: [Common Scenario]

**User Input**:
"..."

**Good Response** ✅:
"..."
*Why it's good*: [explanation]

**Bad Response** ❌:
"..."
*Why it's bad*: [explanation]

**Reject Response** 🚫:
"..."
*Trigger conditions*: [when to refuse]
```

**Safety Boundaries**:
- Hard boundaries (always block)
- Soft boundaries (contextual)
- Escalation paths (human-in-loop)
- Privacy protections

**Model Specifications**:
- Temperature setting (creativity vs consistency)
- Max tokens (input/output limits)
- Fallback model (reliability)
- Response time targets

---

### 8. Context-Aware Chat Integration

**File Context Passing**:
```typescript
{
  type: 'file',
  content: activeFile.content,
  fileName: activeFile.name
}
```

**Chat Behaviors**:
- Pass active file content as context
- Enable file-specific refinement
- Support multi-file coordination
- Maintain conversation history per project

**Refinement Patterns**:
- "Update the success metrics section with..."
- "Add edge cases for team collaboration..."
- "Clarify the behavioral contract around..."

---

### 9. Template Selection Logic

```typescript
function generatePRD(context) {
  const stage = context.productStage || '0-to-1'

  if (stage === '0-to-1') {
    return generate0to1PRD(context)  // Discovery/Validation focus
  } else if (stage === '1-to-n') {
    return generate1toNPRD(context)  // Scaling/Growth focus
  } else {
    return generateNtoXPRD(context)  // Optimization/Excellence focus
  }
}
```

**Context Object**:
```typescript
{
  productName: string
  productStage: '0-to-1' | '1-to-n' | 'n-to-x'
  aiCapability?: string
  targetUser?: string
  successMetric?: string
  coreProblem?: string
}
```

---

### 10. Reference Integration

**All generated content follows**:
- Base: `/docs/specifications/ai_prd_guidelines/`
- Master template: `10_ai_prd_master_template.md`
- Stage assessments: `opportunity-assessment-{stage}.md`

**File Footer Pattern**:
```markdown
---
*References:
- [AI PRD Guidelines](../../ai_prd_guidelines/)
- [Master Template](../../ai_prd_guidelines/10_ai_prd_master_template.md)
- [Stage Assessment](../../ai_prd_guidelines/opportunity-assessment-0to1.md)*
```

---

### 11. Persistence & State Management

**LocalStorage Keys**:
```typescript
'multi-file-prd-store': {
  files: Record<string, PRDFile>
  activeFileId: string | null
  openTabs: string[]
  fileTree: FileNode[]
  recentFiles: string[]  // Last 10
}

'multi-file-recent-projects': string[]  // Last 5 projects
```

**File State Tracking**:
- Modified state per file (unsaved changes indicator)
- Last modified timestamp
- Content size tracking
- Recent files list

---

### 12. Quality Standards

**Every generated file must include**:

✅ **Quantitative Targets**: Not just "improve performance" but "reduce p95 latency to <100ms"
✅ **Concrete Examples**: Not abstract principles, actual scenarios
✅ **Decision Trees**: For ambiguous situations
✅ **Success Criteria**: Measurable, time-bound outcomes
✅ **Rollback/Pivot Criteria**: When to stop or change direction

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
❌ Generic boilerplate ("This feature will delight users")
❌ Vague requirements ("Should be fast and reliable")
❌ Missing acceptance criteria
❌ No edge case documentation
❌ Skipped safety boundaries

---

### 13. Iteration Support

**Chat-Driven Refinement**:
- "Refine the behavioral examples for customer support scenarios"
- "Add more specific success metrics for enterprise adoption"
- "Update technical requirements based on real-time collaboration needs"

**Bulk Operations**:
- Regenerate entire PRD with new stage context
- Update all files to reflect scope changes
- Propagate metric changes across sections

**Cross-File Consistency**:
- Metrics in Section 6 match Implementation Plan milestones
- Technical Requirements align with Solution Design
- Edge Cases reference Behavioral Contract examples

---

### 14. Generation Workflow

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Detect Stage**: Extract from user message or ask explicitly
2. **Gather Context**: Maximum 2 follow-up questions
3. **Select Template**: Choose 0→1, 1→n, or n^x template
4. **Generate Files**: Create 13 modular files with stage-appropriate content
5. **Populate README**: Create navigation hub with current status
6. **Initialize Store**: Save to localStorage for persistence
7. **Open First File**: Start with README or Problem Definition
8. **Enable Chat**: Activate context-aware refinement

---

### 15. Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

❌ **Don't ask more than 3 questions** before generating
❌ **Don't generate generic boilerplate** - be specific to user context
❌ **Don't mix stage-specific content** - 0→1 PRD shouldn't have n^x features
❌ **Don't skip behavioral examples** for AI products (minimum 5)
❌ **Don't omit safety boundaries** when handling user data
❌ **Don't forget kill/pivot criteria** especially for 0→1 products
❌ **Don't use vague metrics** - specify exact targets with timeframes
❌ **Don't create orphaned sections** - ensure cross-references work
❌ **Don't ignore user's stated constraints** - respect budget/timeline/team limits
❌ **Don't over-engineer for early stages** - 0→1 needs simple, not comprehensive

---

### 16. Example Generation Flow

**User Input**: "I want to build an AI-powered code review assistant"

**AI Response**:
```
I'll help you create a PRD for an AI code review assistant. First, let me understand your stage:

**Stage Question**: Are you:
- 0→1: Creating something new, validating the concept?
- 1→n: Scaling an existing code review tool?
- n^x: Optimizing a mature product for competitive edge?
```

**User**: "It's a new idea, 0→1"

**AI Response**:
```
Perfect! For a 0→1 AI code review assistant, let's focus on validation and learning.

**Context Question**: What's the core problem you're solving?
- Slow manual code reviews?
- Inconsistent review quality?
- Knowledge transfer for junior developers?
- Security vulnerability detection?
```

**User**: "Junior developers need faster feedback on code quality issues"

**AI Response**:
```
Excellent! Generating your 0→1 PRD for an AI code review assistant focused on providing fast feedback to junior developers on code quality...
