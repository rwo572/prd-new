# Solution Design

## Solution Hypothesis and Approach

### Core Hypothesis
prd-dev transforms product development by treating PRDs as executable code - versionable, trackable, and directly translatable into working prototypes. By combining AI-powered requirement clarification with seamless prototype generation, we eliminate the traditional gap between product thinking and implementation.

### Strategic Approach
The solution leverages the convergence of three technological capabilities:
1. **Advanced AI models** (GPT-4, Claude) capable of understanding complex product requirements and generating production-quality code
2. **Modern web technologies** (WebContainer, Monaco Editor) enabling full development environments in the browser
3. **Git-native workflows** becoming standard across all disciplines, not just engineering

Our approach is fundamentally different from traditional PRD tools - instead of creating static documentation that becomes outdated, we create living specifications that evolve with the prototype and remain synchronized throughout development.

## Why AI is Necessary and Beneficial

### AI as Product Thinking Amplifier
AI serves as more than a writing assistant - it acts as an experienced product manager that:
- **Uncovers hidden requirements** through Socratic questioning
- **Detects ambiguity and conflicts** before they become implementation blockers
- **Suggests industry best practices** based on product patterns and user types
- **Maintains consistency** across complex requirement documents

### AI-Powered Prototype Generation
The breakthrough capability is direct PRD-to-prototype translation:
- **Eliminates manual interpretation** - no more translating requirements into code
- **Enables rapid iteration** - modify prototypes with natural language commands
- **Maintains requirement traceability** - every prototype element maps back to PRD specifications
- **Provides instant validation** - stakeholders see working functionality, not static mockups

### Privacy-First AI Integration
By using client-side AI processing with user-provided API keys:
- **Zero data retention** - no proprietary product ideas stored on servers
- **Immediate responses** - no queue delays or rate limiting from shared services
- **Model flexibility** - users can choose between OpenAI, Anthropic, or future models
- **Cost transparency** - users control their AI spending directly

## Technical Approach

### AI Model Strategy
**Primary Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for balanced speed and quality
- Temperature: 0.3 for consistent, working code
- Context window: Optimized for long-form PRDs (100K+ tokens)
- Response streaming: <1 second to first token

**Fallback Model**: GPT-4 Turbo for redundancy
- Automatic failover on API unavailability
- Cost optimization through model selection
- Performance monitoring and automatic switching

### Progressive Enhancement Pattern
**Stage 1 - Wireframe (0-2 seconds)**:
- Basic layout structure with placeholder content
- Navigation skeleton and component boundaries
- Immediate visual feedback to maintain user engagement

**Stage 2 - Styled (2-5 seconds)**:
- Design system application (colors, typography, spacing)
- Interactive elements and hover states
- Responsive breakpoint implementation

**Stage 3 - Interactive (5-10 seconds)**:
- State management and data flow
- Form validation and user interactions
- API integrations and dynamic content

### Performance Optimization

## Core Concepts and Key Capabilities

### PRD-as-Code Philosophy
Traditional PRDs are static documents that quickly become outdated. Our approach treats PRDs as living code:
- **Version Control**: Every change tracked through Git history
- **Executable Specifications**: PRDs directly generate working prototypes
- **Continuous Validation**: Real-time linting ensures quality and completeness
- **Collaborative Evolution**: Multiple contributors with merge conflict resolution

### Intelligent Requirement Discovery
AI acts as an experienced product manager to surface hidden requirements:
- **Socratic Method**: Strategic questions that reveal unstated assumptions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies missing requirements based on product type
- **Conflict Detection**: Highlights contradictory specifications before implementation
- **Best Practice Integration**: Suggests industry standards and compliance requirements

### Contextual Code Generation
Beyond simple template generation, the AI understands product context:
- **Business Logic Inference**: Generates appropriate state management and data flow
- **UI Pattern Matching**: Selects optimal component patterns for use cases
- **Progressive Complexity**: Starts simple, adds sophistication through iteration
- **Framework Intelligence**: Adapts output based on target deployment environment

## Technical Decisions That Affect User Experience

**Decision**: Resizable panels with minimum width constraints (150px)
**UX Impact**: Users can customize their workspace while maintaining usability
**Technical Constraint**: Smooth 60fps drag performance requires optimized React rendering

### Real-Time AI Streaming
**Decision**: Stream AI responses token-by-token rather than waiting for completion
**UX Impact**: Users see immediate progress, reducing perceived wait time
**Technical Implementation**: Server-sent events with client-side buffering and display optimization

### Client-Side Execution Environment
**Decision**: Use WebContainer API for in-browser code execution
**UX Impact**: Instant prototype updates without server round-trips
**Trade-offs**: Limited to browsers supporting WebContainer (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Progressive Code Generation
**Decision**: Three-stage generation (wireframe → styled → interactive)
**UX Impact**: Immediate visual feedback maintains engagement during generation
**Technical Approach**: Parallel processing with staged rendering to optimize perceived performance

### Local-First Data Architecture
**Decision**: All data stored in browser localStorage/IndexedDB
**UX Impact**: Instant app loading, works offline, complete privacy
**Technical Complexity**: Sophisticated sync logic for collaborative features

### Natural Language Interface for Prototype Refinement
**Decision**: Allow prototype modifications through conversational commands
**UX Impact**: Non-technical users can iterate on prototypes without code knowledge
**AI Challenge**: Requires sophisticated intent recognition and code modification capabilities

### Contextual Linting with Auto-Fix
**Decision**: Real-time quality analysis with AI-generated suggestions
**UX Impact**: Immediate feedback prevents quality issues, reduces iteration cycles
**Performance Requirement**: <500ms response time to maintain typing flow

These architectural decisions prioritize user experience over technical simplicity, resulting in a product that feels responsive and intelligent while maintaining the privacy and performance standards expected by professional product teams.
