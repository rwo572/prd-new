## Feature Evolution Strategy

### MVP → Phase 2 Evolution
| MVP Feature | Phase 2 Enhancement | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Single-user editing | Real-time collaboration | Enable team workflows |
| Local storage only | GitHub integration | Version control and backup |
| Basic templates | Custom templates | User-specific patterns |
| Simple chat | Advanced AI assistance | Deeper product insights |

### Intentional Limitations (MVP)
- **Single Project Focus**: No dashboard or project management
- **Template-Only**: No custom PRD structure creation
- **Basic Export**: No direct deployment or hosting
- **Limited History**: No advanced versioning or branching

*Rationale: Focus on core value prop validation before feature expansion*

### Non-Goals (Any Phase)
- **General-Purpose Writing Tool**: Not competing with Notion or Google Docs
- **Project Management Platform**: Not replacing Jira, Linear, or Asana
- **Design Tool**: Not competing with Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD
- **Full-Stack IDE**: Not replacing VS Code, IntelliJ, or similar

## Success Boundaries

### MVP Success Definition
**Primary**: Validate that AI-powered PRD generation significantly reduces time-to-prototype
**Secondary**: Prove product-market fit with solo creators and small teams
**Constraints**: Maintain 100% privacy and zero-data-persistence architecture

### Failure Criteria (Would Trigger Scope Reduction)
- PRD generation takes >2 hours (target: <30 minutes)
- Prototype success rate <60% (target: 90%+)
- User retention <30% at 30 days (target: 60%+)
- Performance degrades below targets (>5s load time, >10s prototype generation)

### Pivot Triggers
- AI API costs exceed $50/user/month
- Browser compatibility issues prevent 50%+ user adoption
- Privacy regulations require server-side data storage
- Competitive landscape makes differentiation impossible
