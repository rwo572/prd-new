## 5.1 Hard Boundaries (Always Block)

### Content Safety Guardrails

| Category | Examples | Detection Method | Response Template |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Harmful Content** | Violence, harassment, hate speech in PRDs | Content filtering + keyword detection | "I cannot assist with creating specifications that promote harmful content..." |
| **Privacy Violation** | Requests for personal data collection, PII exposure | Pattern matching for data requests | "For privacy reasons, I cannot include specifications for collecting personal information without proper safeguards..." |
| **Illegal Activity** | Fraudulent features, circumventing regulations | Legal compliance checking | "I'm not able to help with specifications that may violate laws or regulations..." |
| **Deception** | Misleading users, dark patterns, false claims | UX pattern analysis | "I cannot create specifications for deceptive user interfaces or misleading features..." |

### AI-Specific Safety Boundaries

| Risk Category | Hard Boundaries | Detection | Response |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Model Misuse** | Using AI for surveillance, manipulation | Intent classification | "AI capabilities should be used to empower, not manipulate users..." |
| **Bias Amplification** | Discriminatory features, exclusionary design | Fairness review prompts | "Let's ensure this feature is inclusive and accessible to all user groups..." |
| **Over-reliance** | Features that eliminate human oversight | Human-in-loop validation | "This feature should include appropriate human oversight and control..." |

## 5.2 Soft Boundaries (Contextual Response)

### Contextual Safety Framework

| Category | Low Risk Response | Medium Risk Response | High Risk Response |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Data Usage** | Provide best practices | Add privacy disclaimers | Suggest privacy-by-design approach |
| **AI Capabilities** | Explain limitations | Add fallback mechanisms | Recommend human oversight |
| **User Impact** | Note considerations | Add user testing requirements | Suggest impact assessment |

### Progressive Response Strategy

```markdown
1. **Educational**: Provide context and best practices
2. **Cautionary**: Add warnings and disclaimers
3. **Redirective**: Suggest safer alternative approaches
4. **Protective**: Decline and explain safety concerns
```

## 5.3 Bias Mitigation

### Training Data & Output Monitoring

- **Diverse Use Cases**: Ensure PRD examples span different industries, user demographics, and product types
- **Inclusive Language**: Monitor for biased language in generated specifications
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Always include accessibility considerations in feature specifications
- **Fair Representation**: Ensure user personas and examples represent diverse backgrounds

### Bias Detection Mechanisms

| Bias Type | Detection Method | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Demographic** | User persona analysis | Require diverse persona representation |
| **Technical** | Feature complexity review | Suggest inclusive design patterns |
| **Cultural** | Language pattern analysis | Provide culturally aware alternatives |
| **Economic** | Pricing/access analysis | Include accessibility considerations |

### Fairness Metrics

- **Representation**: User personas include diverse demographics
- **Accessibility**: Features meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Language**: Specifications use inclusive, clear language
- **Economic**: Features consider various economic contexts

## 5.4 Privacy & Data Protection Framework

### Data Handling Matrix

| Data Type | Collection | Storage | Usage | Retention | User Control |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **PRD Content** | User-created | Local browser only | Document generation | User-controlled | Full delete capability |
| **AI Interactions** | Chat messages | Temporary memory | Context improvement | Session-based | Clear history option |
| **Usage Analytics** | Optional only | Aggregated | Product improvement | 30 days max | Opt-out available |
| **API Keys** | User-provided | Encrypted local storage | AI service access | User-managed | User deletion |

### Privacy-by-Design Principles

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for core functionality
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
3. **Transparency**: Clear privacy policies and data usage explanations
4. **User Control**: Users can view, edit, and delete their data
5. **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data, secure transmission
6. **No Tracking**: No cross-session tracking or profiling

### GDPR & Privacy Compliance

- **Right to Access**: Users can export their PRD content
- **Right to Rectification**: Users can edit their specifications
- **Right to Erasure**: Users can clear all stored data
- **Right to Portability**: Export in standard formats
- **Privacy by Default**: Most restrictive privacy settings initially

## 5.5 Incident Response Plan

### Safety Incident Categories

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Critical** | Harmful content generated | Immediate | Block feature + review |
| **High** | Privacy violation detected | <1 hour | Content review + user notification |
| **Medium** | Bias/fairness concern | <24 hours | Pattern analysis + improvement |
| **Low** | Misleading suggestion | <48 hours | Content refinement |

### Response Workflow

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring + user reporting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification + impact analysis
3. **Response**: Immediate containment + user notification
4. **Resolution**: Root cause analysis + fix implementation
5. **Prevention**: Pattern analysis + guardrail updates

### User Reporting Mechanism

```markdown
Safety Report Options:
- In-app feedback button: "Report Safety Concern"
- Email: safety@prd-dev.com
- Anonymous form: privacy-focused reporting
- Clear escalation path for urgent issues
```

## 5.6 Ethical AI Development Principles

### Core Values

1. **Beneficial**: AI should help users create better products
2. **Non-maleficent**: Avoid harmful applications or misuse
3. **Autonomous**: Preserve human agency and decision-making
4. **Just**: Fair and equitable access to AI capabilities
5. **Explicable**: Transparent about AI limitations and reasoning

### Development Guidelines

- **Human-Centered**: AI augments rather than replaces human creativity
- **Transparent**: Clear communication about AI capabilities and limitations
- **Accountable**: Human oversight for all AI-generated content
- **Inclusive**: Accessible to users with diverse needs and backgrounds
- **Sustainable**: Consider long-term impact on users and society

### AI Ethics Review Checklist

- [ ] Does this feature empower users without manipulating them?
- [ ] Are AI limitations clearly communicated?
- [ ] Is human oversight maintained for critical decisions?
- [ ] Does the feature promote inclusive design?
- [ ] Are potential misuse cases addressed?
- [ ] Is user privacy protected by default?
