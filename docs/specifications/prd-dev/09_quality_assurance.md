# Quality Assurance
## Testing Strategy & Validation Framework

---

## QA Philosophy & Strategy

### Quality-First Development Approach
prd-dev implements a comprehensive quality assurance framework that ensures both the platform itself and the content it generates meet professional standards. Our QA strategy encompasses four critical dimensions:

1. **Platform Quality**: The application's reliability, performance, and user experience
2. **AI Output Quality**: The accuracy, completeness, and safety of AI-generated content
3. **Generated Code Quality**: The standards and best practices of prototype code
4. **PRD Content Quality**: The comprehensive real-time linting and validation system

### Risk-Based Testing Priority
- **P0 Critical**: Core user workflows (PRD generation, prototype creation)
- **P1 High**: AI model performance and fallback systems
- **P2 Medium**: Advanced features and edge cases
- **P3 Low**: Nice-to-have enhancements and optimizations
