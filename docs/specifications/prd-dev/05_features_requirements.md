- **US002**: As a solo PM, I want AI to ask me the right questions to uncover requirements I haven't considered so that I avoid costly implementation mistakes
- **US003**: As a technical founder, I want my PRD to generate production-ready code so that my development team can start building immediately

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
Given I have a product idea
When I describe it in natural language to the AI
Then the system should generate a complete PRD in <2 hours
And produce a working prototype in <10 seconds
And maintain 100% privacy with no data leaving my browser
```

#### 2. Product Manager (Tech Company)
**Profile**: PM at established tech company managing complex product features
**Goals**: Stakeholder alignment and clear handoff to engineering teams
**Pain Points**: PRDs become outdated during development, causing misalignment

**User Stories**:
- **US004**: As a product manager, I want real-time linting of my PRD so that I catch ambiguities and missing requirements before development begins
- **US005**: As a PM, I want to collaborate with engineering on PRD refinements using Git workflows so that we maintain a single source of truth
- **US006**: As a product manager, I want to generate prototypes from PRDs so that stakeholders can see and interact with proposed features

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
Given I'm writing a PRD for a complex feature
When I use the AI-powered linter
Then it should identify 95%+ of ambiguous requirements
And suggest specific improvements with confidence scores
And maintain <500ms response time for real-time feedback
```

#### 3. Design Engineer
**Profile**: Technical designer or engineer who bridges design and development
**Goals**: Clear specifications that translate directly to development work
**Pain Points**: Ambiguous requirements lead to implementation uncertainty and rework

**User Stories**:
- **US007**: As a design engineer, I want PRDs with executable acceptance criteria so that I know exactly what to build
- **US008**: As a design engineer, I want to iterate on prototypes using natural language commands so that I can refine implementations quickly
- **US009**: As a technical designer, I want generated code to follow best practices and be production-ready so that I don't need to refactor

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
Given I receive a PRD with prototype
When I review the acceptance criteria
