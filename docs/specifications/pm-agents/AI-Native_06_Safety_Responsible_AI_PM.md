4) Bias/fairness checks; mitigation strategies and KPIs.
5) Privacy: data minimization, consent, retention, auditing.
6) Crisis & sensitive use handling (health, legal, finance).
7) Incident handling: escalation, reporting, corrective actions.
8) Developer UX: clear guidance, examples, and defaults.
