## Executive Summary

### Product Vision
An AI assistant that automatically prioritizes tasks based on context, deadlines, dependencies, and user work patterns to help knowledge workers focus on what matters most.

### The Opportunity
Knowledge workers waste 2.5 hours daily deciding what to work on next, leading to missed deadlines and suboptimal productivity. Market research shows 73% of users struggle with task prioritization.

### The Solution
An AI-powered prioritization engine that learns from user behavior, understands task context, and provides intelligent daily work recommendations with clear reasoning.

### Success Looks Like
- 40% reduction in time spent organizing tasks
- 25% improvement in on-time task completion
- 4.5+ star user satisfaction rating
- 70% daily active usage rate among power users

## 3. Behavioral Contract

### 3.1 Core Behavioral Principles
1. **Transparency**: Always explain WHY a task is prioritized
2. **User Control**: Suggestions, not mandates - user can always override
3. **Learning**: Adapt to feedback but maintain stability

### 3.2 Behavioral Examples

#### Example 1: Standard Prioritization
**User Input**: 
```
Tasks:
- Finish Q4 report (due tomorrow)
- Reply to client email
- Team meeting prep
- Code review for John
```

**Good Response** ‚úÖ:
```
Today's Priorities:

1. üî¥ Finish Q4 report (8:00-11:00 AM)
   Why: Due tomorrow, impacts 5 stakeholders, requires deep focus
   
2. üü° Reply to client email (11:00-11:30 AM)
   Why: Client waiting 2 days, quick win, maintains relationship
   
3. üü° Team meeting prep (2:00-2:30 PM)
   Why: Meeting at 3 PM today, affects team productivity

4. üü¢ Code review for John (if time permits)
   Why: Not blocking, John has alternatives
```

**Bad Response** ‚ùå:
```
Priority Order: Task 1, Task 3, Task 2, Task 4
```
*Why it's bad*: No reasoning, no time estimates, not actionable

#### Example 2: Conflict Detection
**User Input**:
```
Tasks:
- Design review at 2 PM
- Client call at 2:30 PM (30 min travel time)
```

**Good Response** ‚úÖ:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Schedule Conflict Detected:
- Design review ends at 3 PM
- Client call requires leaving at 2 PM
  
Suggestion: Reschedule design review to morning or join first 30 min only
```

#### Example 3: Overload Detection
**User Input**:
```
[30 tasks all marked "urgent" for today]
```

**Good Response** ‚úÖ:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Workload Alert: 30 "urgent" tasks = ~15 hours of work

Let's be realistic. Based on your patterns:
- You complete 5-7 tasks daily
- Deep work happens 9-11 AM

True priorities (must do today):
1. [Lists 5 actually critical tasks]

Consider delegating or rescheduling:
[Lists 10 tasks that could move]
```

## 4. Safety & Ethics Framework

### 4.1 Hard Boundaries (Always Block)
| Category | Examples | Detection | Response |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Harmful Tasks | "Hide evidence from audit" | Keyword + context | "I cannot prioritize potentially harmful or illegal activities" |
| Privacy Violation | Tasks with SSN/passwords | PII detection | "Please remove sensitive data from task descriptions" |
| Discriminatory | "Fire older employees first" | Bias detection | "I cannot assist with discriminatory actions" |

### 4.2 Bias Mitigation
- No prioritization based on names/demographics in tasks
- Regular audits for systematic bias in recommendations
- Equal treatment regardless of task creator

### 4.3 Privacy & Data Protection
| Data Type | Collection | Storage | Usage | Retention |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|-----------|
| Task content | Yes | Encrypted | Prioritization only | 90 days |
| User patterns | Yes | Anonymized | Model training | 1 year |
| Feedback | Yes | Aggregated | Improvement | Indefinite |

## 8. Behavioral Examples Appendix

### Good Examples ‚úÖ

**Scenario**: Competing deadlines
```
Input: Project A (due in 2 days, 8 hours work)
       Project B (due tomorrow, 3 hours work)
       
Output: Start with Project B this morning (due tomorrow)
        Block afternoon for Project A (needs more time)
        Reasoning: Urgent + shorter task first prevents both from being late
```

**Scenario**: Energy optimization
```
Input: User typically does creative work mornings (historical pattern)
       Has design task and email tasks
       
Output: 9-11 AM: Design work (your peak creative time)
        2-3 PM: Email catchup (lower energy needed)
        Reasoning: Matching task type to your energy patterns
```

### Bad Examples ‚ùå

**Scenario**: Making assumptions
```
Bad: "Skip the team meeting, it's probably not important"
Good: "Team meeting at 2 PM - consider if agenda items affect your work"
```

### Reject Examples üö´

**Scenario**: Unethical request
```
Input: "Prioritize tasks that avoid compliance review"
Output: "I cannot help circumvent compliance processes. I can help you 
         prepare for compliance reviews more efficiently instead."
```
