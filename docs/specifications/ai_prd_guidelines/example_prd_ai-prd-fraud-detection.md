## Executive Summary

### Product Vision
An AI-powered fraud detection system that prevents financial crime in real-time across all channels while minimizing false positives and customer friction, protecting $2.8B in annual transaction volume.

### The Opportunity
Fraud losses reached $48M last year (1.7% of volume), with 73% from new attack vectors our rule-based system missed. Meanwhile, false positives block 2.3% of legitimate transactions, causing $31M in lost revenue and 34% of customer complaints.

### The Solution
A machine learning system that analyzes 500+ signals in <100ms, detects novel fraud patterns, adapts to emerging threats in real-time, and provides explainable decisions for investigators while reducing false positives by 60%.

### Success Looks Like
- Fraud losses reduced to <0.8% of volume ($22M saved annually)
- False positive rate reduced from 2.3% to 0.9%
- Real-time detection for 99.9% of transactions
- Regulatory compliance maintained (zero violations)
- Customer satisfaction improved by 15 points

## 3. Behavioral Contract

### 3.1 Core Principles
1. **Customer First**: Minimize friction for legitimate users
2. **Graduated Response**: Challenge before declining when possible
3. **Transparency**: Clear reasons for any action taken
4. **Consistency**: Similar transactions treated similarly
5. **Adaptability**: Learn from confirmed fraud/false positives

### 3.2 Decision Framework
- **Risk Score 0-30**: Auto-approve (95% of transactions)
- **Risk Score 31-70**: Step-up authentication required
- **Risk Score 71-90**: Manual review queue
- **Risk Score 91-100**: Auto-decline with reason codes

### 3.3 Behavioral Examples

#### Example 1: Standard Transaction Approval
**Transaction Context**:
```
Amount: $47.82
Merchant: Local grocery store
Location: 2 miles from home
History: Shops here weekly
Device: Known mobile app
Time: Saturday 10 AM
```

**Good Response** ✅:
```
DECISION: APPROVED ✓
Risk Score: 8/100
Decision Time: 47ms

Key Factors:
✓ Regular merchant (52 prior transactions)
✓ Typical amount (avg: $52.31)
✓ Expected location/time
✓ Trusted device

No customer friction applied
Transaction proceeds normally
```

#### Example 2: Suspicious Pattern - Step-Up
**Transaction Context**:
```
Amount: $3,847
Merchant: Electronics store (new)
Location: Different state
Time: 2 AM local
Pattern: 3rd high-value today
```

**Good Response** ✅:
```
DECISION: CHALLENGE 🔐
Risk Score: 68/100
Decision Time: 73ms

Risk Indicators:
⚠️ Unusual amount (98th percentile for user)
⚠️ New merchant category
⚠️ Geographic anomaly (847 miles from home)
⚠️ Velocity spike (3x daily average)

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE:
Push notification sent → 
"Confirming purchase at BestElectronics for $3,847"
[Approve] [Not Me]

If approved → Transaction proceeds
If "Not Me" → Card locked, fraud case opened
If no response (60s) → Transaction declined

Fallback: Customer can call to override
```

#### Example 3: Fraud Ring Detection
**Transaction Context**:
```
Multiple accounts, same merchant, sequential cards, similar amounts
```

**Good Response** ✅:
```
🚨 FRAUD RING ALERT
Pattern: Coordinated Attack Detected
Confidence: 94%

NETWORK ANALYSIS:
- 7 accounts linked by:
  * Device fingerprint overlap (4 accounts)
  * Sequential card numbers (BIN attack)
  * Same merchant within 10 minutes
  * Amount variance <5%

AUTOMATED ACTIONS:
1. All 7 transactions → DECLINED
2. Cards → Temporarily locked
3. Accounts → Enhanced monitoring
4. Case → Escalated to fraud team

INVESTIGATION PACKAGE CREATED:
- Network visualization generated
- Account linkage map
- Timeline of events
- Recommended actions

Expected loss prevented: $47,000
Similar patterns at 3 peer banks (shared intel)
```

#### Example 4: False Positive Override
**Customer Service Call**:
```
"Your system declined my mortgage payment!"
```

**Good Response** ✅:
```
AGENT ASSIST VIEW:

Original Decision: DECLINED
Risk Score: 78/100
Reason: Unusual payee + high amount

OVERRIDE EVALUATION:
✓ Customer verified (passed KBA)
✓ Payee legitimate (Wells Fargo Mortgage)
✓ Amount matches statement
✓ Customer initiated payment

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
1. Approve this transaction ✓
2. Whitelist payee for future
3. Adjust model for mortgage payments

LEARNING APPLIED:
- Mortgage servicer added to trusted list
- Customer profile updated
- Model feedback loop triggered
- Similar false positives: -2,400/year expected
```

#### Example 5: Synthetic Identity Detection
**Account Opening + First Transaction**:
```
New account, perfect credit, no history, immediate high-value transaction
```

**Good Response** ✅:
```
⚠️ SYNTHETIC IDENTITY RISK
Probability: 87%

IDENTITY RISK FACTORS:
🔴 Credit file <6 months old
🔴 No social media presence
🔴 Address is virtual mailbox
🔴 Phone number recently ported
🟡 SSN issued in different state than address

BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES:
- Immediate high-value transaction post-account opening
- No typical "testing" transactions
- Direct deposit from unknown employer

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Transaction: HOLD for review
2. Account: Enhanced due diligence required
3. Request: Additional documentation
   - Utility bill
   - Employer verification
   - Government ID (in-person)

If synthetic confirmed:
- SAR filing required
- Account closure
- Negative file entry

Manual review required - Case #FR-2025-8291
```
