# How to Write a Working Backwards PR/FAQ Document

> Start with the customer and work backwards—harder than it sounds but a clear path to innovating and delighting customers. A useful working backwards tool: writing the press release and FAQ before you build the product.

## Introduction

Most of Amazon's major products and initiatives since 2004 have one thing in common—they were created through a process called **Working Backwards**. It is so central to the company's success that we used it as the title for our book. Working Backwards is a systematic way to vet ideas and create new products. Its key tenet is to start by defining the customer experience, then iteratively work backwards from that point until the team achieves clarity of thought around what to build. Its principal tool is a second form of written narrative called the **PR/FAQ**, short for Press Release and Frequently Asked Questions.

## Why Amazon Created the PR/FAQ Process

At Amazon, focusing on the customer is so central to the management mindset that it is the company's first Leadership Principle:

> **Customer Obsession.** Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

The Working Backwards PR/FAQ process was created so that every leader at Amazon could stay focused on the needs of customers while building and inventing new products.

Start with the customer and work backwards…easy right? In practice, it is much harder than it sounds. We encountered this firsthand in 2005 as we sought to create new businesses in digital media and web services. The set of tools we initially applied to identify new business opportunities included:

- S.W.O.T. analysis
- Gathering research on expected market size and growth rate of each new business sector
- Drafting a pro forma P&L

We applied all of these and more but after a few meetings we realized that none of these tools required us to think about the needs of customers and how we could create something new and valuable for them.

We then tried other tools like mock-ups and lengthy documents describing each new product idea. Through a process of trial and error (and Jeff's insight) we eventually landed on the idea of writing a press release and a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to describe each new product. 

Normally, writing the press release is literally the last step in the process of launching a new product. When you are writing the press release, you are laser focused on how to describe your product so that, when a potential customer reads about it in the press, they will be excited and compelled to buy it. You aren't focused on your competitors, your current capabilities, the P&L, your business partners or any other consideration. Writing a press release is a forcing function to ensure that the creator of the new product idea is laser focused on the customer. Once you have written a compelling press release then you and your team can work backwards from there, using the FAQ process, to figure out how to bring your new product vision to market.

## Press Release Components

### 1. Heading
Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. One sentence under the title.

### 2. Subheading
Describe the customer for the product and what benefits they will gain from using it. One sentence only underneath the Heading.

> **Critical Note:** Describing the customers precisely here is critical. If you think your product is for everyone, you are mistaken. Great products are tailored to the specific needs of a specific customer segment. 
> 
> For instance, if you are designing a new car, you need to decide whether your customer is:
> - a) Urban, single professionals under 35 who live in apartments, or
> - b) Suburban families, 35+ with dual incomes, 3 kids, a dog and the need to carpool to soccer games
> 
> Carefully defining the customer segment you are serving is critical.

### 3. Summary Paragraph
Start with the city, media outlet, and your proposed launch date. Give a summary of the product and the benefit. The launch date should have meaning. That is, pick a date when you expect to actually launch this product. At first, this will be a rough estimate but by the final draft this will be the actual planned launch date.

### 4. Problem Paragraph
This is where you describe the problem(s) that your product is designed to solve. Make sure that you write this paragraph from the customer's point of view.

This sounds simple but, in practice this requires a deep understanding of customer needs. Even if you understand their needs, there may be more than one problem that you could solve. Spend time considering which problem(s) is most important to the customer. Not all problems are created equal. 

You need to identify a problem with a large total addressable market (TAM). The market size is the number of customers who have this problem multiplied by how much money each is willing to pay to solve it. The problem is not worth solving if there is either a small population of potential customers or customers aren't willing to pay a price to solve it.

### 5. Solution Paragraph(s)
Describe your product in some detail and how it simply and easily solves the customer's problem. For more complex products, you may need more than one paragraph.

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Direct Solution:** The solution needs to directly address the problem. For example, if the customer's problem is that they need organic fruits, vegetables, and healthy snacks delivered to their home between 6 am and 8 am two times per week, then the solution must be squarely focused on these needs and not other potential needs like providing personalized recommendations for which fruit to buy. The best products simply and directly address the primary customer need rather than provide a laundry list of features that may sound worthwhile.

2. **Sufficient Detail:** The solution needs to be described in sufficient detail so that it is clear how it addresses the problem. Long, vague or high-level descriptions are ineffective. A great product solution is described with both clarity and brevity.

3. **Competitive Differentiation:** The solution must acknowledge the competition and state how this new product is meaningfully differentiated from the other products or methods that the target customer uses to solve the problem today. Your paragraph should include something like: 
   > "Today, customers who have this problem use x, y or z products to meet their needs. Those products fall short in solving x problem(s). Our product addresses these unmet needs in the following ways."

The solution(s) you describe here relative to competition is how your product is differentiated and creates value. If your proposed product solution solves the same problems in roughly the same ways as existing products, then you need to go back to the drawing board.

### 6. Quotes & Getting Started
- Add one quote from you or your company's spokesperson
- Add a second quote from a hypothetical customer in which they describe the benefit they are getting from using your new product
- Describe how easy it is to get started
- Provide a link to your website where customers can get more information and get started

## The FAQ

A well written PR defines a specific objective—a destination where there is treasure. Think of the FAQ section as the map to that destination along with a detailed description of the dragons you will need to slay along your journey. The questions you ask and the answers you provide explain what problems you need to solve, and how your team proposes to solve them.

### External FAQs
This is where you provide detailed answers to the questions that you can expect the press and customers to ask such as:
- How does it work?
- What is the warranty?
- What is the return policy?
- How do I install it?

These are relatively straightforward questions but the details you provide in your answer matter a lot. The External FAQ is a dialogue with your customer addressing their most important issues.

### Internal FAQs
A well written internal FAQ section anticipates the most important questions that senior leaders and stakeholders in the company will ask after reading the PR. Anticipate questions from every department in the company:
- Finance
- Marketing
- Customer Support
- Operations
- HR

Additionally, the internal FAQ should cover all of the challenging problems that need to be solved in order to build the product, whether they are technical, financial, legal, or operational.

A great FAQ demonstrates mastery of every aspect of the product. It should be:
- Optimistic but also realistic
- Demonstrate that the authors aren't looking through rose-colored glasses
- Include a data-based assessment of the potential market for the product
- Show a firm grasp of what will be required to build it
- Address the risks involved
- Define the conditions under which the product will succeed or fail
- Demonstrate that multiple options were considered for both the customer problem and a range of product ideas to solve it

## The Process of Writing a PR/FAQ

One of the great things about the PR/FAQ process is that **anyone can use it**. Whether you are a college student, an entry-level employee at a big company, or a C-Level executive, you don't need specialized design or coding skills, you just need to be able to write. This also means that it is possible for individuals and teams to write many different PR/FAQs as a way to consider a wide range of possibilities. 

For complicated projects, you may need more than one PR/FAQ document. For example, Fulfillment By Amazon usually had two PR/FAQs, one from a seller perspective and one from a buyer perspective.

### The Iterative Process

The best PR/FAQs are produced through an iterative process requiring discussion, debate and collaboration with many stakeholders:

1. **Solo Effort:** Early on, the document is a solo effort, and the author is typically a product manager
2. **Research Phase:** In early drafts the PR/FAQ will typically have many holes and questions that haven't been answered yet requiring the author(s) to do research to fill in the blanks
3. **Peer Review:** Once more of the blanks are filled in, the author seeks out feedback from their manager and a few relevant (ideally cross-functional) peers
4. **Team Review:** Eventually the early draft is ready for a first review with a cross-functional team of stakeholders and a leader/decision maker. For the first few drafts, a small group of about 10 contributors makes sense
5. **Executive Review:** Once the decision maker in the small group is satisfied with the document, they set a meeting to share it with the appropriate Executive(s) at the company
6. **Refinement:** If the Executive team finds the idea promising, multiple subsequent drafts and review meetings will follow

## The PR/FAQ Review Meeting

A common misconception is that the goal of any PR/FAQ meeting is to "sell" the idea to the reviewers, and for the decision maker to give it a thumbs up or thumbs down. This was not the case at Amazon where we were focused more on **truth seeking vs selling**, and **improving vs deciding**.

### Meeting Structure

A well run PR/FAQ meeting is an opportunity for each reviewer to both:
- Get a deeper understanding of the proposed idea
- Ask questions and give feedback

**Meeting Flow:**
1. Document is circulated at the start of the meeting
2. 15-20 minutes of silent reading and note taking
3. Participants add their comments and questions to the Word or Google Doc
4. Remaining 40 minutes are open for questions, debate and discussion
5. Discussion can be done either on a "go around the room" basis or a page-by-page basis
6. The authoring team addresses comments and questions from the document, and takes detailed notes

### Reviewer Evaluation Criteria

The reviewer's job is to objectively evaluate:
1. Is the customer clearly defined?
2. Is the problem clearly defined?
3. Does the proposed solution address the problem?
4. Would we expect a customer to change their behavior to buy/use the solution?
5. Is the TAM and the payback big enough?

The reviewer feedback (especially from the Executive decision maker) informs the changes to how the product is described in the PR and FAQs. The authoring team takes this feedback and does additional work, research and makes the relevant changes to the PR/FAQ before the next review.

## The Decision

At some point, a level of completion of the PR/FAQ document is reached and a go/no-go decision can be made. 

### If Approved (Go)
What happens next should be well understood because it is described in the FAQs:
- Resources (people, money, fixed cost investments)
- Rough timeline
- Other operational matters

An Executive leader will need to stay in touch with the new team and leader with monthly or weekly reviews depending on the timing and nature of the new product.

### If Not Approved (No-Go)
There are a range of reasons why this can happen and the potential next steps:

1. **Insufficient Differentiation:** The solution is a "copycat" or not sufficiently differentiated vs current products. Go back to the drawing board and come up with new ideas.

2. **Small TAM:** The TAM is too small. Go back to the drawing board and determine if there are changes that can be made in the target customer set, the problem or solution to grow the TAM.

3. **High Risk/Low Return:** The upfront investment is high and the payoff is risky and/or low. Find ways to get started with fewer resources.

4. **Technical Blockers:** The product is not viable at this time because of one or more unsolved problems described in the FAQ. In this case, the PR/FAQ may be revisited in future quarters or years if/when there is a solution.

5. **Resource Constraints:** You would like to move forward with the idea but not at this time because you already have a lengthy backlog of other ideas with greater or equal potential. In this case, the product may be added to the backlog (months or quarters in the future), or it may be just below the cut-line in terms of new product ideas that you can staff.

## Putting it All Together

Understanding the mechanics of writing a PR/FAQ is of course important to making this process work for you. Taking a step back, let's review a hypothetical case of how this process can produce the right result for you and your organization which is designing and building products that create real value for customers and your company.

### Example: Car Company

Let's imagine you are the head of a division for a car company and you are trying to come up with your next new model. The first step is for you and your team to write a few different press releases where each one describes a different potential new model that you could build.

#### Bad Example: Phoenix 400
In one press release you describe the Phoenix 400—a new mid size SUV. As described in the PR:
- Gasoline powered
- Capacity of a midsize SUV
- Jeep-like design
- Cloth interior
- Price of $65,000

Essentially, there aren't any elements of this product that are relatively better/faster/cheaper than the already crowded mid-sized SUVs available to customers today.

You may have written the release describing such a ho-hum car because it is based on the current technology, engineering and manufacturing and cost management capabilities of your car company today. That is, you started with what your company is able to do and worked backwards from there. **This press release should be discarded before even writing an FAQ.**

#### Good Example: Excel 850
The better approach is to start from a point of describing a car that your customers would be excited to own. You write a new press release for a new zero emissions electric car called the Excel 850. As described in the PR:
- Range of 850 miles
- Re-charge time of 15 minutes
- Capacity of a large SUV
- Handling of a sports car
- Elegant design
- Luxurious interior
- Price of $19,000

Who wouldn't want to own this car?! This is an example of a PR that starts with customer needs and describes a new product that is meaningfully better/faster/cheaper than the alternatives.

Of course the challenge in the case of the Excel 850 is that you have described a product that exceeds the technology, engineering and cost of manufacturing abilities of not only your own company, but every other car maker on the planet. Making this product a reality will require you and your team to solve multiple technical, engineering and manufacturing problems.

**In one respect, this is what you want.** A great PR defines a valuable destination. You and your team create value through the problems you solve on behalf of customers in order to arrive at this destination before your competitors do. If your PR doesn't require you and your team to solve at least one hard problem with a new and innovative approach then you should probably go back to the drawing board, and keep iterating on the PR until it does. The challenge is to innovate in ways that are possible in a near-term timeframe.

## Appendix 1: Watch Outs & Common Mistakes

### Speed vs Velocity
Identifying and articulating a high value customer problem and product solution is not an easy task. Nor is it easy to develop detailed solutions to a wide range of challenges and problems described in the FAQs. If it were easy, companies would be turning out innovative new products all the time. The PR/FAQ process is most effective when multiple drafts have been reviewed and discussed with a cross functional team and with senior management over the course of many meetings.

For the most successful products at Amazon, this process required months of work before we finalized the PR/FAQ and we approved hiring the team and beginning production. Outside of Amazon, most people have a deeply negative reaction to the notion of spending weeks and months writing PR/FAQs before they start building a product. Obviously this will slow down, not speed up innovation, right?

**In our experience, people tend to confuse speed with velocity.**
- **Speed** measures ft or meters per second but there is no direction
- **Velocity** on the other hand is a vector. Velocity is speed with a direction

In other words, if you want to go fast but don't care about the direction or the destination, then you want speed. On the other hand, to reach a specific destination, you want velocity.

#### AWS Example
Amazon Web Services is proof of the effectiveness of this approach:
- Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy identified web services as an important new technology in 2004
- They didn't launch the foundational services of AWS (S3 and EC2) until 2006
- Jeff, Andy and the early members of the team spent more than a year writing, revising, debating and discussing PR/FAQs
- They worked to determine what problems AWS was trying to solve, who were their customers and what were the right product solutions

Once they finalized the initial AWS PR/FAQs, the most important decisions had been made and the details of the products to build were clearly captured in the documents. This meant that anyone at Amazon could read these documents and come away with the same understanding of the product plan. By investing so much time up front in planning, they were able to move fast in the production phase. Jeff Bezos wrote in Amazon's 2015 letter to shareholders that, "AWS is bigger than Amazon.com was at 10 years old, growing at a faster rate."

It takes conviction and discipline to say, "We are not ready yet to start building. We need more clarity on these next few issues first." But over time, we realized that this approach got us to our end goal of delivering value for customers at scale much faster than we otherwise would have done.

### Selling vs Truth Seeking
Great decisions are made by understanding an issue and the many alternatives to solve that issue. When you try to "sell" an idea to "win" approval and budget, you impede this process. The way to get around this is by understanding and articulating in the document what will prevent the product from being a success by asking and answering questions like:
- What needs to be true for this product to be successful?
- What new, innovative, unique approach have we developed in order to address barrier x?

### Discount Competition & Current Solutions
It is a mistake to discount or not properly factor in the competition. If the customer problem is big, they already have some product or method of dealing with it today. Make sure to be clear about this in the FAQ by addressing these questions:
- What are the solutions today for customers? 
- Is this solution compelling enough for people to switch from their current solution (there is always a current solution)?
- Can we reasonably believe that customers will change their behavior and switch to our solution because it is better/faster/cheaper than the current solutions?

### Customer Backwards, Not Skills Forward
With the PR/FAQ process, you start by envisioning an innovative product for customers and work backward from there to identify the capabilities you will need to add/acquire and problems you will need to solve. Most companies have a tendency to view new business ideas and opportunities using a **skills forward approach** where they rely on their current business model, skills and capabilities. The PR/FAQ process is designed to decouple the concept of what new products customers want from what we are good at building today.

We give the example in our book about how Amazon approached the problem of making the leap from selling hardcover books, CDs and DVDs to digital media. The first new product we built was the Amazon Kindle, a connected device combined with a digital media service, two domains where Amazon had no prior capabilities or expertise. Later, in digital video, we would also add the capability of our own TV and movie studio too.

Before we built these new capabilities, many leaders inside Amazon thought that doing so would be very risky and expensive. In retrospect, it would have been much more risky to have not built device hardware and digital media service capabilities and to have seen the opportunity to miss out on being a leader in a new, large and growing business segment (digital media).

### Great Product, Wrong Problem
If you build a great product that doesn't solve a problem that matters to customers, it won't result in a healthy new business. One could argue that the Amazon Fire Phone is an example of this. With four forward facing cameras, the innovative technology in this phone produced 3D effects when navigating and using apps. Unfortunately, this technology when applied to mobile apps didn't solve any important problems for customers. The Fire Phone flopped.

This is why getting the problem right is so important. It can't be a problem that has already been solved with a similar product unless your new product creates additional value by being meaningfully better, faster, or cheaper.

### Works with Agile
Used appropriately, the PR/FAQ process is used at the beginning of the new product development process. Once the PR/FAQ is finalized and approved, the Agile process can be employed as a method for building the product. Agile was frequently used at Amazon in conjunction with the PR/FAQ process.
