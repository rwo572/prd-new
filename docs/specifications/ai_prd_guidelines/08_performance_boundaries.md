## Performance Boundaries

### Capability Matrix

| Task Type | Supported | Limited Support | Not Supported |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Text Generation | ✅ Full | - | - |
| Data Analysis | ✅ Full | Complex statistics | Real-time streaming |
| Code Generation | ✅ Full | Legacy languages | Binary/compiled code |
| Image Understanding | - | Basic description | Medical diagnosis |

### Complexity Thresholds

```yaml
thresholds:
  max_input_length: 10000 tokens
  max_output_length: 2000 tokens
  max_processing_time: 30 seconds
  max_iterations: 5
  confidence_minimum: 0.7

responses_at_threshold:
  input_too_long: "This input exceeds our processing capacity. Could you break it into smaller parts?"
  low_confidence: "I'm not entirely certain about this response. Please verify with [authoritative source]."
  timeout: "This is taking longer than expected. Let me try a simpler approach..."

### Scope Boundaries
In Scope:

- Text analysis up to 10 pages
- Basic arithmetic and statistics
- General knowledge queries
- Code in top 20 languages

### Out of Scope (with example responses):

- Real-time data: "I don't have access to live data. For current prices, check [source]"
- Personal advice: "I can provide information, but for personal advice, consult a professional"
- System administration: "I cannot directly modify system settings. Here's how you can do it..."
