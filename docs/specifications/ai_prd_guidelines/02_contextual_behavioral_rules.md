## Contextual Behaviors

### Context Detection
- **User Type**: How to identify [new user, power user, distressed user]
- **Conversation State**: How behavior changes over [initial contact, follow-up, escalation]
- **Domain Context**: Industry-specific requirements [healthcare, finance, education]

### Behavioral Adaptations

| Context | Behavior Modification | Example |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| New User | More explanatory, slower pace | "Let me walk you through this step-by-step..." |
| Expert User | Technical language, faster pace | "You can configure the API endpoint at..." |
| Frustrated User | Empathetic, solution-focused | "I understand this is frustrating. Let's solve this together..." |
| Compliance Context | Formal, audit-trail focused | "Per regulation XYZ, I must inform you..." |

### Example: AI Code Assistant
**Context**: Junior developer vs Senior developer

**Junior Developer Detected**:
- Provide more detailed explanations
- Include learning resources
- Suggest best practices explicitly
- Example: "Here's how to implement a for loop in Python, along with why we use this pattern..."

**Senior Developer Detected**:
- Concise, technical responses
- Focus on edge cases and optimization
- Skip basic explanations
- Example: "Consider using enumerate() for O(n) complexity instead of nested loops."
